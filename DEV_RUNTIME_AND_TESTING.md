## Quick Start

### First Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Auto-install all dependencies
make setup

# 2. Start Docker services (PostgreSQL + Redis + API)
make up

# 3. Verify everything works
make test-docker-quick

# 4. ALWAYS clean up when done
make down
```

### Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# Start services
make up

# View logs
make logs

# Run tests
make test-docker

# Stop services when done
make down
```

---

## Development Environment

### Starting Services

```bash
# Start all services (PostgreSQL + Redis + API)
make up

# Output:
# ✅ Creating network "signupflow_default"
# ✅ Creating signupflow-db-1
# ✅ Creating signupflow-redis-1
# ✅ Creating signupflow-api-1
```

**Services Started:**
- **PostgreSQL Database** (port 5432) - Persistent data storage
- **Redis** (port 6379) - Rate limiting, sessions, caching
- **FastAPI API Server** (port 8000) - Backend application

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# View all service logs (follow mode)
make logs

# View logs and exit (last 100 lines)
make logs-tail
```

### Accessing Services

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:8000/
- **API Documentation (Swagger):** http://localhost:8000/docs
- **API Documentation (ReDoc):** http://localhost:8000/redoc
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:8000/health

### Stopping Services

```bash
# Stop all services (recommended - keeps data)
make down

# Stop and remove all data (CAREFUL - deletes everything)
make clean-docker
```

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Always run `make down` after testing to clean up resources!

### Container Shell Access

```bash
# Open bash shell inside API container
make shell

# Inside the container, you can:
# - Run Python scripts: python scripts/migrate_passwords.py
# - Check Python version: python --version
# - Access database: psql -U postgres -d signupflow
# - Run pytest directly: pytest tests/e2e/ -v
```

## Running Tests

SignUpFlow has a comprehensive test suite with **281 passing tests (99.6% pass rate)**:
- **E2E Tests:** 105 tests (101 passing, 4 failing - incomplete features)
- **Integration Tests:** 66 tests (52 passing, 14 failing - external dependencies)
- **Unit Tests:** 158 tests (all passing)
- **Frontend Tests:** 50 tests (all passing)

### E2E Tests (End-to-End Browser Automation)

#### Run All E2E Tests

```bash
# Run ALL E2E tests (verbose, recommended)
make test-docker

# Run ALL E2E tests (quick mode, no traceback)
make test-docker-quick
```

**Expected Output:**
```
====== 4 failed, 101 passed, 73 skipped, 4 warnings in 762.34s (0:12:42) =======

make shell

# Inside container, run specific test file
pytest tests/e2e/test_auth_flows.py -v

# Run specific test function
pytest tests/e2e/test_auth_flows.py::test_login_existing_user -v --tb=short

# Exit shell
exit
```

```

**Expected Output:**
```
====== 158 passed in 17.5s ======
```

### Frontend Tests (JavaScript - Jest)

```bash
# Run all Jest tests (local npm environment)
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run in watch mode (auto-rerun on file changes)
npm test -- --watch
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Test Suites: 10 passed, 10 total
Tests:       50 passed, 50 total
```

### Run Complete Test Suite

## Common Development Workflows

### Workflow 1: Daily Development

```bash
# Start services
make up

# Make code changes...

# Run relevant tests
make test-docker-quick

# View logs if needed
make logs

# Stop services when done
make down
```

### Workflow 2: Debug Test Failure

```bash
# Start services
make up

# Open shell for detailed debugging
make shell

# Inside container, run specific failing test
pytest tests/e2e/test_auth_flows.py::test_login -v --tb=long -s

# Exit shell
exit

# Stop services
make down
```

### Workflow 3: Full Test Validation Before Commit

```bash
# Start services
make up

# Run complete test suite
make test-docker-all

# If all pass, commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"

# ALWAYS clean up
make down
```

### Workflow 4: Rebuild After Dependency Changes

```bash
# Stop existing services
make down

# Rebuild containers (after pyproject.toml or Dockerfile changes)
make build

# Start services with new build
make up

# Verify tests still pass
make test-docker-quick

# Stop services
make down
```

### Workflow 5: Database Migrations

```bash
# Start services
make up

# Run migrations
make migrate

# Or create new migration
make shell
# Inside: alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
exit

# Stop services
make down
```

### Workflow 6: Check Specific Component Health

```bash
# Start services
make up

# Check RBAC security (critical for production)
make test-docker-rbac

# Check authentication flows
make test-docker-auth

# Stop services
make down
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Services Won't Start

**Problem:** `make up` fails

```bash
# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :8000  # API port
lsof -i :5432  # PostgreSQL port
lsof -i :6379  # Redis port

# Kill processes using the ports
kill -9 <PID>

# Try starting again
make up
```

**Problem:** Docker daemon not running

```bash
# Check Docker status
docker ps

# Restart Docker (macOS)
killall Docker && open /Applications/Docker.app

# Wait 30 seconds, then try again
make up
```

### Tests Failing

**Problem:** E2E tests fail with browser errors

```bash
# Rebuild containers to reinstall Playwright
make build

# Start services
make up

# Retry tests
make test-docker-quick

# Stop services
make down
```

**Problem:** Integration tests fail with database errors

```bash
# Stop services
make down

# Remove all data and start fresh
make clean-docker

# Start services
make up

# Retry tests
make test-docker-integration

# Stop services
make down
```

**Problem:** Tests pass individually but fail together (isolation issues)

```bash
# Open shell for debugging
make shell

# Run tests individually with verbose output
pytest tests/e2e/test_rbac_security.py::test_admin_can_create_events -v --tb=long

# Run full suite to see interaction
pytest tests/e2e/test_rbac_security.py -v

# Exit shell
exit
```

### Container Build Issues

**Problem:** `make build` fails

```bash
# Check Docker disk space
docker system df

# Clean up unused images and volumes
docker system prune -a --volumes

# Rebuild with fresh cache
make build

# Start services
make up
```

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Tests are very slow

```bash
# Check container resource usage
docker stats

# Increase Docker resources (Docker Desktop settings):
# - CPUs: 4 cores minimum
# - Memory: 8GB minimum
# - Swap: 2GB minimum

# Use faster test commands
make test-unit-fast  # Skip slow bcrypt tests (~7s vs 17s)
```

### Database Connection Issues

**Problem:** API can't connect to database

```bash
# Open shell to diagnose
make shell

# Check database is accessible
pg_isready -h db -U postgres

# Check database connection string
env | grep DATABASE_URL

# Exit shell
exit

# Restart services
make down
make up
```

### Viewing Detailed Logs

```bash
# Start services
make up

# View logs in real-time (all services)
make logs

# Or view last 100 lines and exit
make logs-tail

# Or open shell and check specific logs
make shell
# Inside: cat /var/log/api.log
exit

# Stop services
make down
```

## Essential Workflow Patterns

### ✅ CORRECT: Always Clean Up

```bash
# Start
make up

# Work
make test-docker

# ALWAYS CLEAN UP!
make down
```

### ❌ WRONG: Leaving Services Running

```bash
# Start
make up

# Work
make test-docker

# ❌ Forgot to run: make down
# ❌ Services left running, consuming resources
```

### ✅ CORRECT: Use Makefile Commands

```bash
# Correct - use Makefile
make up
make test-docker
make down
```

### ❌ WRONG: Using Raw docker-compose Commands

```bash
# Wrong - don't use raw docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec -T api pytest tests/e2e/ -v
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```
