## Known Issues & Limitations

### Test Issues

1. **Resources Endpoint Missing** (7 tests affected)
   - Issue: `/resources/` endpoint doesn't exist in API
   - Impact: 11 tests written but can't run
   - Solution: Create resources router or remove tests
   - Priority: Low (resources handled via events.resource_id currently)

2. **Test Data Isolation** (Minor, intermittent)
   - Issue: Some tests fail on repeated runs without clean DB
   - Impact: 1-2 tests may fail if DB not cleaned between runs
   - Solution: Use `./test_clean.sh` or unique timestamps in IDs
   - Status: Mitigated by test scripts

3. **Availability Test Setup** (1 test)
   - Issue: One availability test has data setup edge case
   - Impact: 1/10 availability tests may fail
   - Priority: Low

### Application Issues (From Testing)

4. **Solver Generates 0 Assignments** (Known)
   - Issue: With minimal test data, solver produces empty schedules
   - Impact: Export tests can't verify actual content
   - Solution: Need realistic test data (10+ people, recurring events)
   - Status: Documented, not blocking

5. **No Recurring Events** (P0 Feature Gap)
   - Issue: Have to manually create each Sunday service
   - Impact: Major UX problem for weekly schedules
   - Solution: Implement RRULE support (RFC 5545)
   - Priority: **HIGH**

6. **No Notifications** (P0 Feature Gap)
   - Issue: People don't know when they're assigned
   - Impact: Poor user experience
   - Solution: Email notifications via SendGrid/AWS SES
   - Priority: **HIGH**
