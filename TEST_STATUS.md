## Failing Tests Analysis

### Minor Issues (Status Code Mismatches)

**These are not bugs - just test expectations needing adjustment:**

1. **test_delete_event_success** - Expects 200, gets 204 (No Content)
   - API correctly returns 204 for successful DELETE
   - Fix: Update test to accept [200, 204]

2. **test_delete_person_success** - Same issue as above
   - Fix: Update test to accept [200, 204]

3. **test_create_person_duplicate_id** - Expects 400, gets 409 (Conflict)
   - API correctly returns 409 for conflict
   - Fix: Update test to expect 409

### Data Isolation Issues

4. **test_create_org_success** - Expects 200/201, gets 409 (Conflict)
   - Likely test data collision from previous runs
   - Fix: Add test isolation (unique IDs per test run) OR use fixtures with teardown

5. **test_update_org_success** - Description field not returned
   - API may not be returning optional null fields
   - Fix: Check API response schema or adjust test expectations

6. **test_update_org_partial** - Same issue as #5
   - Fix: Same as above

## Missing Test Coverage

### High Priority

1. **Teams Endpoints** (5 endpoints untested)
   - POST /teams/ - Create team
   - GET /teams/{id} - Get team
   - PUT /teams/{id} - Update team
   - DELETE /teams/{id} - Delete team
   - POST /teams/{id}/members - Add member

2. **Resources Endpoints** (5 endpoints untested)
   - POST /resources/ - Create resource
   - GET /resources/{id} - Get resource
   - PUT /resources/{id} - Update resource
   - DELETE /resources/{id} - Delete resource
   - GET /resources/ - List resources

3. **Constraints Endpoints** (5 endpoints untested)
   - POST /constraints/ - Create constraint
   - GET /constraints/{id} - Get constraint
   - PUT /constraints/{id} - Update constraint
   - DELETE /constraints/{id} - Delete constraint
   - GET /constraints/ - List constraints

### Medium Priority

4. **E2E User Journeys** (0 tests)
   - Complete onboarding flow (signup → join org → create profile)
   - Admin creates event → assigns people → generates schedule → exports
   - Volunteer logs in → views schedule → requests time off → admin approves
   - Shift swap workflow (request → approve → notification)

5. **GUI Component Tests** (13 more needed)
   - Login form validation
   - Event creation form
   - Time-off request form
   - Schedule calendar interactions
   - Admin dashboard actions
   - Export buttons
   - Error message displays

6. **Edge Cases & Error Handling**
   - Invalid date ranges
   - Overlapping events
   - Double-booking detection
   - Constraint violations
   - Large dataset performance (100+ events, 50+ people)

   - Add Selenium/Playwright for real browser testing

7. **Load Testing** (3 tests, ~1 hour)
   - Test with 100+ events, 50+ people
   - Measure solver performance
   - Identify bottlenecks

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)

8. **Advanced Features** (Once tests are comprehensive)
   - Recurring events (with tests)
   - Shift swap workflow (with tests)
   - Email notifications (with tests)
   - Conflict detection (with tests)

## Test Quality Metrics

### Code Coverage (Estimated)

- **API Routes:** ~80% covered
- **Database Models:** ~60% covered
- **Core Solver:** ~50% covered
- **Frontend:** ~35% covered
- **Overall:** ~65% code coverage

### Test Characteristics

✅ **Good:**
- Tests are well-organized by component
- Clear test names describing what is tested
- Mix of happy path and error cases
- API tests verify actual behavior

⚠️ **Needs Improvement:**
- Test data isolation (failures due to data conflicts)
- Missing teardown/cleanup in some tests
- No performance/load tests yet
- Limited edge case coverage
- No mocking (tests hit real DB)

---

## Recommendations

### For Product Quality

1. **Achieve 90%+ test coverage** before adding new features
2. **Run tests in CI/CD** to catch regressions automatically
3. **Add integration tests for all new features** (TDD approach)
4. **Fix the 6 failing tests** to establish green baseline

### For Development Workflow

1. **Use `./test_clean.sh`** for isolated test runs (already created)
2. **Run unit tests during development:** `poetry run pytest tests/unit/ -v`
3. **Run full suite before commits:** `./run_all_tests.sh`
4. **Check test coverage:** `poetry run pytest --cov=api --cov=roster_cli tests/`

### For Feature Development

Based on [COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md](COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md), prioritize testing for:

1. **Recurring Events** - Critical feature, needs comprehensive tests
2. **Shift Swaps** - Complex workflow, needs E2E tests
3. **Notifications** - Integration tests with email service
4. **Fairness Metrics** - Unit tests for calculation logic
