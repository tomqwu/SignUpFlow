### Step 3: Get API Keys
1. In sandbox dashboard, go to **Developers** → **API keys**
2. Copy your keys:
   - **Publishable key**: `pk_test_...` (safe to use in frontend)
   - **Secret key**: `sk_test_...` (backend only, keep secure)
3. Add to SignUpFlow `.env`:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51...
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51...
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # (created in Step 5)

## Cost Comparison: Real-World Scenario

### SignUpFlow Pricing Tiers (Your Spec)
- Free: $0/mo (10 volunteers)
- Starter: $29/mo (50 volunteers)
- Pro: $79/mo (200 volunteers)
- Enterprise: $199/mo (2000 volunteers)

### Monthly Revenue Scenarios

| Scenario | Customers | MRR | Stripe Cost | Paddle Cost | Chargebee Cost |
|----------|-----------|-----|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Launch** | 100 orgs (50 Starter, 30 Pro, 20 Ent) | $7,920 | $277 (3.5%) | $436 (5.5%) | $599 flat |
| **Growth** | 500 orgs (200 S, 200 P, 100 E) | $45,700 | $1,600 (3.5%) | $2,514 (5.5%) | $942 (0.75% overage) |
| **Scale** | 2000 orgs (800 S, 800 P, 400 E) | $182,800 | $6,398 (3.5%) | $10,054 (5.5%) | $1,971 (0.75% overage) |

**Key Insights**:
- **Stripe wins at every scale** for businesses under $100K MRR
- **Paddle costs 57% more** than Stripe at scale ($3,656 more per month at scale)
- **Chargebee becomes competitive** only after ~$80K MRR (but adds complexity)

### Annual Savings with Stripe
At Growth stage ($45K MRR):
- Stripe: $19,200/year
- Paddle: $30,168/year
- **Savings with Stripe: $10,968/year** (54% less)

At Scale stage ($182K MRR):
