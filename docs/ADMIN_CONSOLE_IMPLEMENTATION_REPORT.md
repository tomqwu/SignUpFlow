### 2. ✅ CSS Styling (`/home/ubuntu/rostio/frontend/css/styles.css`)

**Tab Navigation Styling:**
```css
.admin-tabs - Tab navigation bar with border-bottom

### 3. ✅ JavaScript Functionality (`/home/ubuntu/rostio/frontend/js/app-user.js`)

switchAdminTab(tabName) {
  - Updates URL hash for bookmarking (e.g., #admin-events)
  - Saves tab state to localStorage
  - Updates active button highlighting
  - Shows/hides appropriate content
  - Loads data for selected tab
}
```

**URL Hash Navigation:**
- Reads URL hash on admin dashboard load
- Restores last viewed tab from localStorage
- Supports bookmarking specific admin tabs
- Format: `#admin-{tabName}` (e.g., `#admin-people`)

**Tab-Specific Loading:**
```javascript
switch(tabName) {
  case 'events': loadAdminEvents() + loadAdminStats()
  case 'roles': loadAdminRoles()
  case 'schedule': loadAdminSolutions() + loadAdminCalendarView()
  case 'people': loadAdminPeople() + loadInvitations()
  case 'reports': (static content, no loading)
}
```
