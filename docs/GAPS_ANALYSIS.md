# Rostio - Gaps Analysis & Roadmap

> **Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis of what's missing from USER_STORIES.md and what needs to be built to make Rostio production-ready.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Active Development

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

### Current State:
- **15% Complete** (2/13 priority features)
- **50% P1 Features** (2/4 high-priority items done)
- **Core functionality works**: Solver, calendar, availability
- **Major gaps**: UX polish, notifications, manual editing

### Critical Issues to Address:
1. ‚ùå **No user feedback for many actions** (silent saves)
2. ‚ùå **No form validation messages** (errors not shown inline)
3. ‚ùå **No conflict detection** (can double-book users)
4. ‚ùå **No notifications** (users don't know when scheduled)
5. ‚ùå **Can't manually edit schedules** (solver-only)

---

## üìã Missing User Workflows (Not in USER_STORIES.md)

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Form Validation & Error Handling**

**Current State**: Forms have no visual validation feedback

**Missing**:
- Inline error messages for invalid inputs
- Red borders on error fields
- Success/error states for form submission
- Loading states during async operations
- Disable submit buttons during processing

**Impact**: Users don't know why forms fail
**Priority**: **P0** (Basic UX requirement)

**Example**:
```
When adding time-off with invalid dates:
‚ùå Current: Silent failure or generic alert
‚úÖ Should: Red border on date field + inline error message
```

---

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Confirmation Messages & Loading States**

**Current State**: Many actions happen silently

**Missing**:
- Loading spinners during API calls
- Success confirmation after save
- Progress indicators for long operations (solver)
- Optimistic UI updates

**Impact**: Users don't know if action succeeded
**Priority**: **P0** (Basic UX requirement)

**Example**:
```
When clicking "Add Time Off":
‚ùå Current: Page refreshes, no confirmation
‚úÖ Should: Toast "Time-off added: Dec 20-30" + smooth update
```

---

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Validation at Form Level**

**Current State**: Validation only happens at API level

**Missing**:
- Client-side validation before submission
- Date range validators (end > start)
- Email format validation
- Required field indicators (*)
- Character count limits

**Impact**: Unnecessary API calls, poor UX
**Priority**: **P1** (Quality UX)

**Example**:
```html
<!-- Current -->
<input type="date" required>

<!-- Should be -->
<div class="form-group">
  <label>Start Date <span class="required">*</span></label>
  <input type="date" required onchange="validateDateRange()">
  <span class="error-message hidden">End date must be after start date</span>
</div>
```

---

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Conflict Detection Before Assignment**

**Current State**: No warning if person already scheduled

**Missing**:
- Check if person has conflicting events
- Check if person marked unavailable
- Check if person serving too frequently (burnout risk)
- Cross-org conflict detection

**Impact**: Double-booking, burnout, scheduling conflicts
**Priority**: **P0** (Critical for usability)

**User Story**:
```
As a coordinator,
When I manually assign Sarah to Sunday 10am,
I should see a warning if:
- She's already scheduled 10am-12pm
- She marked herself unavailable that day
- She's already serving 3 times this month
So that I don't create conflicts or burnout
```

---

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Undo/Redo Functionality**

**Current State**: No way to undo accidental changes

**Missing**:
- Undo delete event
- Undo delete person
- Undo schedule generation
- Restore previous schedule version

**Impact**: Fear of making mistakes, data loss
**Priority**: **P1** (Safety net)

**User Story**:
```
As an admin,
When I accidentally delete an event,
I should be able to undo it within 30 seconds,
So that I don't lose data permanently.
```

---

### 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bulk Operations**

**Current State**: Must perform operations one-by-one

**Missing**:
- Bulk select events
- Bulk delete time-off periods
- Bulk assign people to roles
- Bulk export schedules

**Impact**: Tedious for large organizations
**Priority**: **P2** (Efficiency)

**User Story**:
```
As an admin,
When I need to delete 10 Christmas week events,
I should be able to select all and delete together,
Instead of clicking delete 10 times.
```

---

### 7. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Search & Filter**

**Current State**: No search on any list views

**Missing**:
- Search people by name/email/role
- Filter events by date range/type
- Filter schedules by status
- Search assignments by person

**Impact**: Can't find data in large lists
**Priority**: **P1** (Scalability)

**User Story**:
```
As an admin with 100 volunteers,
When I need to find "Sarah Johnson",
I should be able to search instead of scrolling.
```

---

### 8. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mobile Responsiveness**

**Current State**: Desktop-only design

**Missing**:
- Mobile-friendly calendar view
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Responsive navigation
- Mobile date pickers

**Impact**: Can't use on phone/tablet
**Priority**: **P1** (50% of users on mobile)

---

### 9. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keyboard Navigation & Accessibility**

**Current State**: Mouse-only interface

**Missing**:
- Tab navigation through forms
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S to save)
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Focus indicators
- Skip to content links

**Impact**: Not accessible to disabled users
**Priority**: **P2** (Legal requirement in some jurisdictions)

---

### 10. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Export Options**

**Current State**: CSV export only

**Missing**:
- Excel (.xlsx) export
- PDF reports with formatting
- iCal (.ics) for all events
- JSON export for backup
- Print-friendly views

**Impact**: Limited integration with other tools
**Priority**: **P2** (Nice to have)

---

## üîß Technical Debt & Infrastructure Gaps

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Database Migrations**

**Issue**: Schema changes require manual DB recreation

**Should Have**:
- Alembic migrations
- Version control for schema
- Automatic migration on deploy

**Priority**: **P1** (Required for production)

---

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Error Logging/Monitoring**

- "Remember me" functionality
- Session timeout warnings
- Password strength requirements
- OAuth/SSO integration

**Priority**: **P1** (Security & UX)

---

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Data Backup**

**Issue**: Single SQLite file, no backup strategy

**Should Have**:
- Automated daily backups
- Point-in-time recovery
- Export all data functionality
- Import from backup

**Priority**: **P0** (Critical for production)

---

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Rate Limiting**

**Issue**: API can be abused

**Should Have**:
- Rate limiting per IP
- Request throttling
- API authentication tokens

**Priority**: **P2** (Security)

## üìù User Stories to Add to USER_STORIES.md

### Missing Workflow: Form Validation
```
As a user,
When I submit a form with invalid data,
I should see inline error messages,
So that I know exactly what to fix.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Red border on invalid fields
- [ ] Error message below field
- [ ] Error clears when field is fixed
- [ ] Submit button disabled until valid
```

### Missing Workflow: Conflict Detection
```
As a coordinator,
When scheduling someone,
I should see warnings about conflicts,
So that I don't double-book people.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Warn if person already scheduled that time
- [ ] Warn if person marked unavailable
- [ ] Warn if person serving too often
- [ ] Allow override with confirmation
```

### Missing Workflow: Undo Delete
```
As an admin,
When I accidentally delete something,
I should be able to undo it,
So that I don't lose important data.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] "Undo" toast appears for 30 seconds
- [ ] Clicking undo restores the item
- [ ] Works for events, people, schedules
- [ ] Toast disappears after undo or timeout
```

## üéì Lessons Learned

### From User Feedback:
1. **Test real workflows**: Don't just test that UI exists, test that it WORKS
2. **No silent operations**: Always give feedback (toast/loading/error)
3. **No popups**: Use inline toasts and modals instead
4. **Validate client-side**: Don't wait for API to tell user about errors

### From Development:
1. **Write tests that click buttons**: Not just check they exist
2. **Monitor network requests**: Catch fetch failures
3. **Track dialog events**: Detect unwanted popups
4. **Test end-to-end**: Verify data persists
