## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Option A: Complete Billing System (Recommended)

**Why:** Billing is 70% done and was the #1 blocker. Finishing it enables monetization.

**Tasks Remaining:**

1. **T154: Update API Documentation** (30 mins)
   - Add endpoint descriptions to FastAPI routes
   - Update Swagger UI at `/docs`
   - File: `api/routers/billing.py`

2. **T155: Create BILLING_USER_GUIDE.md** (1 hour)
   - Admin user guide for billing portal
   - Screenshots and workflows
   - Location: `docs/BILLING_USER_GUIDE.md`

3. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - T137: Redis caching (requires Redis setup)
   - T131-T135: Edge case handling (5 tasks)
   - T144-T150: Integration and E2E testing (7 tasks)

**Files to Reference:**
- `specs/011-billing-subscription-system/progress.md` - Current status
- `docs/BILLING_SETUP.md` - Stripe setup guide
- `CLAUDE.md` - Billing architecture documentation

**Completion:** After T154-T155, billing system is **production-ready** (72% → 75% complete).

---

### Option B: Production Infrastructure Deployment

**Why:** Second biggest blocker. App currently runs on localhost only.

**Tasks Required:**

1. **Dockerization** (2-3 hours)
   - Create `Dockerfile` for FastAPI backend
   - Create `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL
   - Environment variable configuration

2. **PostgreSQL Migration** (1-2 hours)
   - Switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL
   - Create Alembic migration scripts
   - Test database schema

3. **Deployment** (2-3 hours)
   - Deploy to Railway/Render/DigitalOcean
   - Configure domain + SSL (HTTPS)
   - Environment variables setup

4. **CI/CD Pipeline** (1-2 hours)
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated testing on PR
   - Automated deployment on merge

**Files to Create:**
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`

**Reference Spec:**
- `specs/003-production-infrastructure/spec.md`

---

### Option C: Email Infrastructure Completion

**Why:** Enables critical features (password reset, notifications, billing emails).

**Status:** MVP complete with Mailtrap (dev only), needs production SendGrid.

**Tasks Required:**

1. **SendGrid Integration** (1-2 hours)
   - Create SendGrid account
   - Add API key to environment
   - Update `email_service.py` for production mode

2. **Email Templates** (2-3 hours)
   - Password reset email
   - Trial expiration warning
   - Payment success/failure
   - Subscription cancellation confirmation

3. **Testing** (1 hour)
   - Test all email flows
   - Verify deliverability
   - Check spam scores

**Files to Update:**
- `api/services/email_service.py`
- `api/templates/email/*.html`
- `tests/e2e/test_email_*.py`

**Reference Spec:**
- `specs/001-email-notifications/spec.md`

## 📋 Full Feature Priority List

### Tier 1: Critical for Launch (Complete These First)

1. ✅ **Billing System** - 70% complete (finish T154-T155)
2. ⏳ **Production Infrastructure** - 0% (Docker + PostgreSQL + deployment)
3. ⏳ **Email Infrastructure** - MVP only (add SendGrid for production)
4. ⏳ **Security Hardening** - 60% (rate limiting, audit logging, HTTPS)
5. ⏳ **Monitoring** - 10% (Sentry error tracking, uptime monitoring)

### Tier 2: UX Polish (After Launch)

6. ⏳ **Recurring Events UI** - 0% (backend exists, needs frontend)
7. ⏳ **Manual Schedule Editing** - 0% (can only auto-generate now)
8. ⏳ **Mobile Responsive Design** - 0% (desktop-only currently)
9. ⏳ **User Onboarding** - 0% (new user experience)

### Tier 3: Nice to Have

10. ⏳ **SMS Notifications** - Planning complete (Twilio integration)
11. ⏳ **Advanced Analytics** - 0% (usage metrics dashboard)

## 🎯 Recommended Next Action

**Start with Option A: Complete Billing System**

**Why:**
1. Billing is 70% done - highest ROI to finish it
2. Only 2 tasks remaining (T154, T155) = ~1.5 hours
3. Unblocks monetization (was #1 blocker)
4. Enables paid subscriptions and usage limits
5. Quick win to build momentum

**After Billing:**
1. Production Infrastructure (Option B)
2. Email Infrastructure (Option C)
3. Security & Monitoring

**Total Time to Production-Ready:** ~2-4 weeks following this path.
