## Risk Tracking

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Clarifications delay billing spec | HIGH | Limit to 3 clarifications max, present options |
| Complex Stripe integration | HIGH | Use Stripe's official SDKs and documentation |
| Infrastructure spec too broad | MEDIUM | Focus on MVP deployment first |
| SMS costs hard to estimate | LOW | Start with Twilio pay-as-you-go pricing |

## Success Criteria

This effort will be considered successful when:

- [ ] All 9 feature specifications created following Spec-Kit workflow
- [ ] All specifications pass constitution compliance checks
- [ ] All specifications have complete user stories with independent E2E tests
- [ ] All specifications have measurable success criteria
- [ ] All 5 BLOCKER specifications ready for implementation
- [ ] All specifications approved and merged to main
- [ ] Implementation can begin immediately after specification approval

**Target Date**: 2025-11-05 (2 weeks from start)

## Notes

### Lessons Learned
- Template fixes must come before specifications (ensures consistency)
- Limiting clarifications to 3 max keeps specification process moving
- User stories with independent E2E tests are more testable
- Constitution compliance checklist prevents rework later

### Process Improvements
- Created progress tracking document for visibility (this file)
- Added TODO list management for systematic execution
- Created comprehensive validation checklists for each spec
- Following strict /speckit.specify workflow for consistency
