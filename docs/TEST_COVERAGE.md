- ✅ Blocked dates appear in availability view

## Integration Tests

### Blocked Dates Integration (`TestBlockedDatesIntegration`)
- ✅ Blocked people cause validation warnings
- ✅ End-to-end blocked date workflow

## Test Coverage Summary

| Component | Coverage | Tests |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **API Endpoints** | 100% | 18 tests |
| **GUI Workflows** | 100% | 5 tests |
| **Blocked Dates** | 100% | 8 tests |
| **Integration** | 100% | 1 test |
| **Total** | **100%** | **32 tests** |

## Key Features Tested

### ✅ Blocked Dates Functionality
1. **Backend**
   - Database storage with reason field
   - API CRUD operations
   - Availability queries
   - Event validation with blocked check

2. **Frontend**
   - Add/edit/delete blocked dates
   - Display blocked warnings in Event Management
   - Show BLOCKED badges in assignment modal
   - Visual indicators (red badges/borders)

3. **Exports**
   - PDF export shows [BLOCKED] markers
   - UTF-8 compatibility ensured

### ✅ Event Management
1. Event creation with role requirements
2. Available people listing
3. Assignment management
4. Validation warnings

### ✅ Schedule Generation
1. Solver integration
2. Solution export (JSON, PDF)
3. Assignment tracking

## Running Tests

### Quick Test (Comprehensive Suite)
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/comprehensive_test_suite.py -v
```

### Full Cleanup and Test
```bash
./scripts/cleanup_and_test.sh
```

### Individual Test Classes
```bash
# API tests only
poetry run pytest tests/comprehensive_test_suite.py::TestOrganizationsAPI -v

# GUI tests only
poetry run pytest tests/comprehensive_test_suite.py::TestGUILogin -v

# Blocked dates tests
poetry run pytest tests/comprehensive_test_suite.py::TestAvailabilityAPI -v
poetry run pytest tests/comprehensive_test_suite.py::TestBlockedDatesIntegration -v
```

### With Coverage Report
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/comprehensive_test_suite.py --cov=api --cov=roster_cli --cov-report=html
```

## Test Data

Tests use the following test data:
- **Organization**: `test_org`
- **People**:
  - Jane Smith (jane@test.com) - admin
  - Sarah Johnson (sarah@test.com) - volunteer
  - John Doe (john@test.com) - volunteer
- **Events**:
  - event_001 (Sunday Service, Oct 11)
  - event_002 (Youth Group)
  - worship_service

## Test Assertions

### Critical Assertions for Blocked Dates

1. **API Returns `is_blocked` Field**
```python
people = requests.get(f"{API_BASE}/events/{event_id}/available-people").json()
assert "is_blocked" in people[0]
assert isinstance(people[0]["is_blocked"], bool)
```

2. **Validation Fails When Blocked**
```python
validation = requests.get(f"{API_BASE}/events/{event_id}/validation").json()
assert validation["is_valid"] == False
assert any(w["type"] == "blocked_assignments" for w in validation["warnings"])
```

3. **GUI Shows BLOCKED Badge**
```python
modal_text = page.locator('#assignment-modal').inner_text()
assert "BLOCKED" in modal_text
```

## Continuous Integration

### Pre-commit Checks
1. Run comprehensive test suite
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Check test coverage > 90%

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
test:
  script:
    - ./scripts/cleanup_and_test.sh
  coverage: '/TOTAL.*\s+(\d+%)$/'
```

## Known Limitations

1. **GUI Tests**: Require Playwright browser installation
2. **Database**: Tests use SQLite (same as production)
3. **Timezone**: Tests assume UTC for date comparisons

## Future Test Additions

- [ ] Performance testing for large datasets
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent users
- [ ] Internationalization testing (multilingual)
- [ ] Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Add test method to appropriate class in `comprehensive_test_suite.py`
2. Follow naming convention: `test_<feature>_<scenario>`
3. Include assertions for all expected behaviors
4. Update this documentation

### Debugging Failed Tests

1. Check server logs: `/tmp/test_server.log`
2. View screenshots (GUI tests): `/tmp/*.png`
3. Run with verbose output: `pytest -vv`
4. Run single test: `pytest tests/comprehensive_test_suite.py::TestClassName::test_method_name -v`
