## üé¨ Final Recommendation

**Status:** Rostio is 80% ready for SaaS launch. The core product is solid, tests are passing, and the technology stack is modern.

**Gap:** The 20% missing is infrastructure (billing, email, deployment) and security hardening, NOT product quality.

**Recommendation:**
1. Choose **Option A (Fast Launch, 6 weeks)** to validate market fit
2. Invest $15k-25k in development + $130 in infrastructure for first 3 months
3. Target break-even at 7-10 paid customers ($203-290 MRR)
4. Once validated, upgrade to **Option B (Production Ready)** infrastructure

**Timeline:**
- **Week 6:** Launch ready (billing, email, deployment, security)
- **Week 10:** Beta testing complete
- **Week 12:** Public launch on Product Hunt

**Risk:** Low. Core product proven, technology stack solid, clear path to launch.
