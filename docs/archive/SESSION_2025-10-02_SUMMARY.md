### 2. Feature Implementation ‚úÖ

#### Feature 1: Edit/Delete Availability (P1 Priority)

**User Story**: "Sarah is going on vacation and needs to update her time-off"

**Backend Implementation**:
```python
# New endpoint: PATCH /api/availability/{person_id}/timeoff/{timeoff_id}
# - Validates date ranges
# - Returns 404 for non-existent entries
# - Full CRUD support
```

**Frontend Implementation**:
```javascript
// Added Edit button next to each time-off entry
// editTimeOff() function with inline date editing
// Both Edit and Remove buttons visible in UI
```

**Files Changed**:
- `api/routers/availability.py` - Added PATCH endpoint
- `frontend/js/app-user.js` - Added editTimeOff() and UI buttons

**Test Coverage**:
- ‚úÖ `tests/test_availability_crud.py` (NEW)
- **17/17 tests passing**
- API CRUD lifecycle tests
- Edge case validation (invalid dates, non-existent IDs, multiple periods)
- GUI workflow end-to-end tests

---

#### Feature 2: Multi-Org Dropdown Visibility (P1 Priority)

**User Story**: "Sarah volunteers at church AND school, needs to switch contexts"

**Frontend Implementation**:
```javascript
// Updated loadOrganizations() to query by email across orgs
// Shows dropdown when user belongs to 2+ organizations
// Shows badge when user belongs to 1 organization
// switchOrganization() handles context switching
```

**Data Model**:
- Person can exist with same email in multiple orgs
- Each org has separate Person record
- Dropdown populated by querying all People with matching email

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/js/app-user.js` - Updated org dropdown logic

**Test Coverage**:
- ‚úÖ `tests/test_multi_org_workflow.py` (NEW)
- Multi-org dropdown visibility test
- Single-org badge display test
- Organization switching test (framework)

---

### 3. Bug Fixes & Improvements ‚úÖ

#### Fixed: View Button CSV Export
**Issue**: User reported "Error exporting schedule: Unknown error"
**Root Cause**: CSV export using `write_assignments_csv()` had StringIO.parent bug
**Solution**: Direct CSV generation using Python's csv.writer()
**Verification**: GUI test confirms download works, success alert shown

#### Fixed: Assignment Count Display
**Issue**: Admin dashboard showed "Assignments: 0" despite solver creating 30
**Root Cause**: Frontend reading `solution.metrics.assignment_count` instead of `solution.assignment_count`
**Solution**: Fixed JavaScript path
**Verification**: Now displays correct count

#### Fixed: Solver Creating 0 Assignments
**Issue**: Generate Schedule button created solutions with 0 assignments
**Root Cause**: Solver passing `required_roles=[]` instead of reading from `extra_data.role_counts`
**Solution**: Extract role requirements from database properly
**Verification**: Solver now creates 30 assignments across 5 events

## üéì Key Learnings

### 1. Test-First Development
**Approach**: Write comprehensive tests before claiming feature complete
**Result**: Caught 3 bugs that would have been missed otherwise
**Example**: View button appeared to work but wasn't actually visible in UI

### 2. End-to-End Workflow Validation
**Approach**: Test complete user journeys, not just isolated functions
**Result**: Discovered UX gaps (prompts instead of modals for edit)
**Example**: Availability edit works but uses browser prompts (can improve)

### 3. Research-Driven Design
**Approach**: Study industry leaders before implementing
**Result**: Features align with user expectations from mature products
**Example**: Multi-org dropdown behavior matches Planning Center

### 4. Documentation as Roadmap
**Approach**: Document all user stories with success criteria first
**Result**: Clear prioritization and implementation guidance
**Example**: Priority matrix drove P1 feature selection

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Immediate (P0 - Critical):

1. **Recurring Events in UI** (Backend exists, needs UI)
   - Add recurrence pattern selector to event creation form
   - Implement "Generate Series" button
   - Bulk edit for event series

2. **Manual Schedule Editing** (High complexity)
   - Drag-drop assignment interface
   - Lock feature for specific assignments
   - Unassigned roles warning

3. **Email Notifications** (Infrastructure needed)
   - Set up SMTP/SendGrid
   - Create email templates
   - Implement notification triggers

### Short Term (P1 - High Priority):

4. **CSV Import Volunteers**
   - Upload interface
   - Field mapping tool
   - Bulk invite emails

5. **Swap/Decline Workflow**
   - Assignment detail modal
   - Replacement suggestion engine
   - Approval workflow

---

## üìù Technical Debt & Improvements

### Identified Issues:

1. **9 Background Bash Servers**
   - Multiple uvicorn servers still running
   - Need better cleanup in test scripts
   - Consider using pytest fixtures

2. **Password Hashing in Tests**
   - Multi-org test needs proper bcrypt hashing
   - Consider test helper function for user creation

3. **Edit UI Using Prompts**
   - Current implementation uses browser `prompt()`
   - Should use modal dialog for better UX
   - Consider date picker widget

4. **No Email Infrastructure**
   - Currently no SMTP configuration
   - Blocks P0 notification features
   - Need environment variables for credentials
