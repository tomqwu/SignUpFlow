# Specification Quality Checklist: Email Notification System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec is free from implementation details. All references to SendGrid, Celery, etc. are in Assumptions section (not requirements). Focus is on what users need, not how it's built.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain âœ… **RESOLVED**
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**:
- âœ… **RESOLVED**: Clarification marker resolved - chose Option A (fixed 24-hour reminder) with documented rationale
- âœ… **Complete**: All functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- âœ… **Complete**: Success criteria use measurable metrics (percentages, time, rates) without technology specifics
- âœ… **Complete**: 5 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios for each
- âœ… **Complete**: 7 edge cases identified with suggested solutions
- âœ… **Complete**: Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries (10 items)
- âœ… **Complete**: Dependencies section lists all external/internal dependencies
- âœ… **Complete**: 10 assumptions documented with clear reasoning

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: âœ… Feature is ready for planning phase. All 15 functional requirements map to user stories. Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable.

## Clarification Resolution

**Question 1: Reminder Timing Configurability** - âœ… **RESOLVED**

**User Choice**: **Option A** - Fixed 24-hour reminder for all organizations

**Rationale Documented in Spec**:
- Follows MVP principles: start simple, iterate based on user feedback
- 24 hours is industry standard based on behavioral research
- Reduces implementation complexity - no admin UI needed
- Faster time to market
- Easy to add configurability in future iteration with usage data
- Avoids premature optimization

**Spec Updated**: Open Questions section now contains resolved decision with full rationale and future iteration plan.

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - Ready for `/speckit.plan`

**Pass**: 12/12 checklist items (100%)
**Fail**: 0/12 checklist items (0%)

**Quality Metrics**:
- âœ… Content Quality: 4/4 (100%)
- âœ… Requirement Completeness: 8/8 (100%)
- âœ… Feature Readiness: 4/4 (100%)
- âœ… Clarifications: 1/1 resolved (100%)

**Next Steps**:
1. âœ… Specification complete and validated
2. âœ… All clarifications resolved
3. âœ… No blocking issues remain
4. ðŸš€ **Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase**

## Specification Highlights

**Comprehensive Coverage**:
- 5 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) with independent test criteria
- 15 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-015)
- 6 non-functional requirements (performance, compliance, scalability)
- 10 measurable success criteria with specific targets
- 7 edge cases identified and solved
- 10 out-of-scope items clearly bounded
- 6 dependencies (3 external, 3 internal)
- 10 documented assumptions with reasoning
- 6 identified risks with mitigation strategies

**Quality Indicators**:
- Zero implementation details in requirements (technology-agnostic)
- All requirements testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria measurable and verifiable
- User-focused language throughout
- Clear scope boundaries and constraints

**Constitution Alignment**:
- âœ… Follows User-First Testing principle (E2E test criteria in each user story)
- âœ… Respects Multi-tenant Isolation (org-specific emails, RBAC enforcement)
- âœ… Maintains i18n standards (6 languages required)
- âœ… Clear documentation throughout
