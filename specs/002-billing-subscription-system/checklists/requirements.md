# Specification Quality Checklist: Billing & Subscription System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASS

- **No implementation details**: Spec uses Stripe only as a named dependency, not implementation detail. All requirements are technology-agnostic (e.g., "System MUST enforce volunteer limits" not "Database constraint MUST block...").
- **User value focused**: All 8 user stories describe business value and user outcomes (e.g., "enables commercial launch", "reduces involuntary churn").
- **Non-technical language**: Written for business stakeholders - uses terms like "organization administrators", "volunteer limits", "subscription plans" rather than technical jargon.
- **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections present: User Scenarios (8 stories), Edge Cases (8 scenarios), Requirements (54 FRs), Success Criteria (12 SCs), Assumptions, Dependencies, Out of Scope.

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASS

- **No clarifications needed**: Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in spec. All decisions made with informed assumptions documented in Assumptions section (12 documented assumptions).
- **Testable requirements**: All 54 functional requirements use "MUST" language and specify verifiable outcomes (e.g., FR-002: "MUST enforce volunteer limits... blocking creation when limit is reached").
- **Measurable success criteria**: All 12 success criteria include specific metrics:
  - Time-based: SC-001 (< 5 minutes), SC-005 (< 60 seconds), SC-007 (< 3 seconds)
  - Accuracy-based: SC-002 (100% accuracy), SC-009 (zero data loss)
  - Rate-based: SC-003 (40% recovery), SC-008 (25% conversion), SC-010 (90% success)
  - Volume-based: SC-004 (99% within 24 hours), SC-011 (< 5% tickets), SC-012 (< 0.5% errors)
- **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: No SC mentions implementation (e.g., SC-002 says "System enforces" not "Database validates", SC-006 says "Webhook processing completes" not "FastAPI endpoint processes").
- **All acceptance scenarios defined**: Each of 8 user stories has 5 Given/When/Then scenarios (40 total acceptance scenarios).
- **Edge cases identified**: 8 edge cases documented with specific handling logic.
- **Scope clearly bounded**: Out of Scope section explicitly excludes 10 items (multi-currency, tax calculation, usage-based billing, reseller pricing, etc.).
- **Dependencies and assumptions**: 6 dependencies listed (Stripe account, email service, existing models), 12 assumptions documented with rationale.

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASS

- **Functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: Each FR maps to user stories with acceptance scenarios. Example: FR-002 (limit enforcement) → US2 scenarios 1-5.
- **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 8 prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) cover complete subscription lifecycle:
  - P1: Sign-up (US1), Limit enforcement (US2) - Critical for launch
  - P2: Upgrade/downgrade (US3), Payment methods (US4), Failed payment recovery (US5) - Revenue retention
  - P3: Invoicing (US6), Cancellation (US7), Analytics (US8) - Post-launch enhancements
- **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: Success criteria map to user stories:
  - SC-001 (< 5 min sign-up) → US1
  - SC-002 (100% limit enforcement) → US2
  - SC-003 (40% recovery rate) → US5
  - SC-008 (25% trial conversion) → US1
- **No implementation leaks**: Spec mentions "Stripe" only as a named dependency with justification ("industry-standard payment processor, reduces PCI compliance burden"). All requirements describe behavior, not implementation ("System MUST enforce" not "Database constraint MUST validate").

## Notes

**All checklist items pass validation.** Specification is complete and ready for next phase.

**Key Strengths:**
1. Comprehensive user story coverage (8 stories, 40 acceptance scenarios, 8 edge cases)
2. Precise measurable success criteria (12 SCs with specific metrics)
3. Well-documented assumptions and dependencies (12 assumptions, 6 dependencies)
4. Clear scope boundaries (10 out-of-scope items explicitly listed)
5. Independent testability (each user story can be tested standalone)

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan
2. No clarifications needed - spec is unambiguous and complete
