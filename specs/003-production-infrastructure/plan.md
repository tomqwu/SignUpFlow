# Implementation Plan: Production Infrastructure & Deployment

**Branch**: `003-production-infrastructure` | **Date**: 2025-10-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-production-infrastructure/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Deploy SignUpFlow to production with Docker containerization, PostgreSQL database migration from SQLite, Traefik reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt, environment-based configuration management (development, staging, production), database backup and restore automation, health check endpoints, graceful shutdown handling, logging aggregation, and CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions. Must support horizontal scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and automated database migrations.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (backend), Vanilla JavaScript (frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Docker (containerization platform)
- PostgreSQL 14+ (production database)
- Traefik 2.x (reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt integration)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipeline)
- Alembic (database migrations)
- FastAPI 0.115+ (existing backend framework)
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+ (existing ORM)
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)
- **NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean) - spec assumes cloud deployment but specific provider not chosen
- **NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: Container orchestration platform (Docker Compose, Cloud Run, ECS Fargate) - spec defers Kubernetes for initial version
- **NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: Log aggregation service (CloudWatch, Stackdriver, Papertrail) - centralized logging destination not specified
- **NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: Secrets management approach (environment variables vs dedicated service) - spec suggests environment variables sufficient initially

**Storage**:
- Development: SQLite (existing)
- Production: PostgreSQL 14+ with connection pooling (100+ concurrent connections)
- Session storage: Redis or equivalent in-memory cache for stateless scaling
- Backup storage: **NEEDS CLARIFICATION** - backup destination (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) not specified
- Container registry: **NEEDS CLARIFICATION** - Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or private registry

**Testing**:
- Backend: pytest (existing test suite - 281 tests, 99.6% pass rate)
- E2E: Playwright (browser automation)
- Infrastructure: **NEEDS CLARIFICATION** - infrastructure testing approach (e.g., Testinfra, ServerSpec)

**Target Platform**:
- Linux server containers (Docker-based)
- **NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: Hosting environment specifics (managed container service, VM-based, serverless containers)

**Project Type**: Web application (FastAPI backend + Vanilla JS frontend)

**Performance Goals**:
- Deployment cycle: <10 minutes (commit → production)
- SSL provisioning: <5 minutes for new domains
- Health check response: <200ms (99% of requests)
- Database restore: <30 minutes (production data volumes <50GB)
- Log forwarding: <60 seconds (container → centralized logging)
- Graceful shutdown: <30 seconds for in-flight request completion

**Constraints**:
- Zero-downtime deployments: 100% success rate (no user-facing request failures)
- Database migration: 100% data integrity (zero records lost or corrupted)
- SSL auto-renewal: 100% success rate (zero certificate expiration incidents)
- Backup success rate: >99.9% (zero undetected backup failures)
- Instance health detection: <30 seconds (failed instance removal from load balancer)

**Scale/Scope**:
- Initial launch: Single geographic region, 1-3 application instances
- Database: Production PostgreSQL handling 100+ concurrent connections
- Organizations: Multi-tenant architecture supporting 1000+ organizations
- Volunteers: 200+ volunteers per organization
- Events: 50+ concurrent events per organization
- Future scaling: Horizontal scaling support (add/remove instances dynamically)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle 1: User-First Testing (E2E MANDATORY)

**Status**: ✅ PASS (with plan)

**Assessment**:
- Infrastructure features don't have traditional "user clicks" but have operational workflows
- E2E tests will verify:
  - Deployment workflow: Push code → GitHub Actions triggers → Deployment completes → Health checks pass
  - SSL provisioning: Configure domain → Certificate obtained → HTTPS works
  - Database backup/restore: Backup runs → Restore works → Data integrity verified
  - Health checks: Endpoint responds → Correct status returned → Unhealthy state detected
- **Plan**: Infrastructure E2E tests using pytest + Docker + subprocess to simulate operational workflows

**No Violations**: Infrastructure testing will verify what operations team EXPERIENCES (deployment success, SSL working, backups restorable), not just that scripts run.

### Principle 2: Security-First Development

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Assessment**:
- No changes to authentication/authorization logic (existing JWT + bcrypt remain)
- Multi-tenant isolation preserved (infrastructure doesn't touch org_id filtering)
- Environment variable management prevents hardcoded secrets
- Security enhancements: HTTPS mandatory, secure secret handling, encrypted backups
- **No new security risks introduced**: Infrastructure layer doesn't handle user data directly

**No Violations**: Infrastructure strengthens security posture without modifying existing security controls.

### Principle 3: Multi-tenant Isolation

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Assessment**:
- Infrastructure layer doesn't touch application data or multi-tenant logic
- Database migration preserves org_id foreign keys and indexes
- PostgreSQL provides same isolation guarantees as SQLite with better concurrency
- Backup/restore maintains all data including org_id relationships
- **No impact on multi-tenancy**: Infrastructure operations are organization-agnostic

**No Violations**: Multi-tenant isolation maintained at application layer, infrastructure transparent to tenants.

### Principle 4: Test Coverage Excellence

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Assessment**:
- Will maintain ≥99% test pass rate (currently 281 passing / 99.6%)
- New infrastructure tests required:
  - Integration tests: Database migration, health checks, graceful shutdown
  - E2E tests: Deployment pipeline, SSL provisioning, backup/restore
  - Unit tests: Configuration validation, migration scripts
- **Existing tests remain passing**: Infrastructure changes don't break application tests

**No Violations**: Test coverage expanded with infrastructure-specific tests maintaining quality standards.

### Principle 5: Internationalization by Default

**Status**: ✅ PASS (not applicable)

**Assessment**:
- Infrastructure layer has no user-facing UI or text
- No i18n requirements for server configuration, deployment scripts, or CI/CD pipelines
- **Not applicable**: Infrastructure features are operational, not user-facing

**No Violations**: i18n principle doesn't apply to infrastructure layer.

### Principle 6: Code Quality Standards

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Assessment**:
- Will follow existing patterns: Docker best practices, GitHub Actions conventions
- Configuration as code: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- Database migrations: Alembic migrations (existing pattern)
- Health check endpoint: FastAPI router pattern (existing convention)
- **No TODO comments**: All infrastructure fully implemented with proper error handling

**No Violations**: Infrastructure code follows industry best practices and SignUpFlow conventions.

### Principle 7: Clear Documentation

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Assessment**:
- Will create/update documentation:
  - `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`: Step-by-step production deployment
  - `docs/DATABASE_MIGRATION.md`: SQLite → PostgreSQL migration procedure
  - `docs/BACKUP_RESTORE.md`: Backup/restore operations
  - `README.md`: Updated with production deployment section
- **CLAUDE.md updates**: Infrastructure section added with deployment commands
- **API docs**: Health check endpoint documented in Swagger UI

**No Violations**: Comprehensive documentation for all infrastructure operations.

### Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ ALL GATES PASS

**No violations detected**. This feature strengthens SignUpFlow's production readiness while maintaining all constitutional principles. Infrastructure layer operates transparently to application layer, preserving existing security, testing, and quality standards.

**Ready for Phase 0 (Research)**: Proceed to resolve "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items and generate detailed technical research.

**Structure Decision**: SignUpFlow uses "Web application" structure with separate `api/` (backend) and `frontend/` directories. This feature adds infrastructure layer alongside existing application code:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: New `docker/` and `traefik/` directories for containerization and reverse proxy configuration
2. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
3. **Database**: Existing `alembic/` directory extended with PostgreSQL migrations
4. **Operations Scripts**: New scripts in `scripts/` for migration, backup, restore
5. **Documentation**: New operational docs in `docs/` directory
6. **Tests**: Infrastructure-specific tests added to existing `tests/` hierarchy

**No Application Code Changes**: Existing `api/` and `frontend/` code remains unchanged except for:
- Health check router added to `api/routers/health.py`
- Database connection modified for PostgreSQL pooling in `api/database.py`
- Graceful shutdown hooks in `api/main.py`

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

**No violations detected** - Complexity tracking table not needed. All constitutional principles satisfied.
