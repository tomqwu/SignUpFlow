# Feature Specification: Production Infrastructure & Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `003-production-infrastructure`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Production infrastructure deployment with Docker containerization, PostgreSQL database migration from SQLite, Traefik reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt, environment-based configuration management (development, staging, production), database backup and restore automation, health check endpoints, graceful shutdown handling, logging aggregation, and CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions. Must support horizontal scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and automated database migrations. Include monitoring integration points for Sentry and uptime checks."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Production Deployment (Priority: P1)

Development team can push code changes to main branch and have them automatically deployed to production with zero downtime. Deployment includes running database migrations, health checks, and automatic rollback if deployment fails.

**Why this priority**: Without automated deployment, launching and maintaining SignUpFlow in production is not feasible. Manual deployment is error-prone and blocks rapid iteration. This is the minimum infrastructure needed for SaaS launch.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by pushing a code change to main branch, verifying GitHub Actions pipeline runs automatically, deployment completes within 10 minutes, application serves traffic without interruption, and health checks pass.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code changes pushed to main branch, **When** GitHub Actions workflow triggers, **Then** automated deployment pipeline runs: build → test → deploy → health check → completion
2. **Given** deployment in progress, **When** health checks fail on new version, **Then** deployment automatically rolls back to previous working version and alerts team
3. **Given** application serving user traffic, **When** new version deploys, **Then** zero requests fail and response times remain under 500ms throughout deployment
4. **Given** database schema changes in migration, **When** deployment runs, **Then** migrations execute automatically before new application version starts
5. **Given** deployment completes successfully, **When** team checks deployment status, **Then** dashboard shows green status with deployment time, version number, and health check results

---

### User Story 2 - Database Migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL (Priority: P1)

Operations team can migrate production data from development SQLite database to production PostgreSQL with data integrity validation and zero data loss. Migration is reversible if issues are discovered.

**Why this priority**: SQLite is suitable for development but not production. PostgreSQL is required for multi-user concurrency, data integrity, and horizontal scaling. Without this migration, production launch is blocked.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running migration script on staging environment with production-like data volume, verifying all tables/indexes/constraints migrated correctly, running data integrity checks, and confirming application functions normally with PostgreSQL.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** SQLite database with production data, **When** migration script runs, **Then** all data transfers to PostgreSQL with 100% record count match across all tables
2. **Given** migration completes, **When** data integrity checks run, **Then** all foreign key relationships, unique constraints, and indexes are correctly established in PostgreSQL
3. **Given** PostgreSQL migration complete, **When** application starts with PostgreSQL connection, **Then** all features work identically to SQLite version with no functionality loss
4. **Given** migration issues discovered, **When** rollback initiated, **Then** application reverts to SQLite backup within 5 minutes with no data loss
5. **Given** PostgreSQL in production, **When** concurrent users access system, **Then** database handles 100+ simultaneous connections without locking or timeout errors

---

### User Story 3 - Automated HTTPS and SSL Certificate Management (Priority: P1)

Operations team can deploy application with automatic HTTPS configuration. SSL certificates are automatically obtained, renewed, and managed without manual intervention or service interruption.

**Why this priority**: HTTPS is mandatory for production SaaS applications (payment processing, user trust, SEO). Manual SSL certificate management is error-prone and causes outages when certificates expire. This must work from day one of launch.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying application to new domain, verifying automatic SSL certificate provisioning within 5 minutes, confirming HTTPS redirection works, and validating certificate auto-renewal 30 days before expiration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new production domain configured, **When** application deploys, **Then** SSL certificate automatically obtained from Let's Encrypt within 5 minutes
2. **Given** HTTP request to application, **When** user accesses via HTTP, **Then** automatic redirect to HTTPS occurs with 301 status code
3. **Given** SSL certificate expiring in 30 days, **When** renewal window opens, **Then** certificate automatically renews without service interruption or manual intervention
4. **Given** SSL certificate renewal fails, **When** retry attempts exhaust, **Then** alert sent to operations team with 7-day lead time before expiration
5. **Given** multiple domains configured (www, api subdomains), **When** deployment runs, **Then** SSL certificates provisioned for all configured domains automatically

---

### User Story 4 - Environment-Based Configuration Management (Priority: P2)

Development and operations teams can maintain separate configurations for development, staging, and production environments. Configuration changes deploy safely without hardcoded secrets in codebase.

**Why this priority**: Essential for secure secret management and environment-specific settings (database URLs, API keys, feature flags). Prevents production incidents from development configuration leaks. Critical for security but can be implemented manually initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying same codebase to dev/staging/production environments, verifying each uses correct database/email/payment credentials, and confirming no secrets exist in git repository or container images.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application deploying to staging environment, **When** configuration loads, **Then** staging database URL, test Stripe keys, and staging email service are used
2. **Given** application deploying to production environment, **When** configuration loads, **Then** production database URL, live Stripe keys, and production email service are used
3. **Given** developer checking out codebase, **When** searching for secrets, **Then** no hardcoded passwords, API keys, or tokens found in repository
4. **Given** configuration change needed in production, **When** operations updates environment variables, **Then** change applies on next deployment without code changes
5. **Given** required environment variable missing, **When** application starts, **Then** startup fails with clear error message listing missing configuration

---

### User Story 5 - Automated Database Backup and Restore (Priority: P2)

Operations team can restore production database from any point-in-time backup within the last 30 days. Backups run automatically daily and are tested monthly to ensure recoverability.

**Why this priority**: Data loss prevention is critical for customer trust and business continuity. Automated backups reduce operational burden and human error. Important for production readiness but can be set up post-launch.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running automated backup script, simulating data loss scenario, restoring from backup to staging environment, and verifying data matches original state with zero record loss.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** production database running, **When** daily backup window occurs, **Then** full database backup completes within 1 hour and stores encrypted backup file
2. **Given** data corruption discovered, **When** operations initiates point-in-time restore, **Then** database restored to specified timestamp within 30 minutes
3. **Given** backup completed, **When** integrity check runs, **Then** backup file validates as complete and restorable with no corruption
4. **Given** 30 days of backups accumulated, **When** retention policy runs, **Then** backups older than 30 days automatically purged while keeping monthly archives
5. **Given** backup restore tested, **When** monthly restore drill runs, **Then** operations confirms successful restore to test environment and documents procedure

---

### User Story 6 - Application Health Monitoring and Graceful Shutdown (Priority: P2)

Operations team can monitor application health through automated endpoints. System handles shutdowns gracefully, completing in-flight requests and preventing data corruption during deployments or restarts.

**Why this priority**: Health checks enable automated deployment validation and load balancer integration. Graceful shutdown prevents request failures during deployments. Improves reliability but not blocking launch if manual health checks acceptable initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by calling health check endpoint and verifying response includes database connectivity, dependent service status, and resource utilization. Trigger shutdown signal and verify in-flight requests complete before process terminates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application running normally, **When** health check endpoint called, **Then** returns 200 OK with JSON showing: database connected, service version, uptime, memory usage
2. **Given** database connection lost, **When** health check endpoint called, **Then** returns 503 Service Unavailable with error details allowing automated recovery
3. **Given** deployment in progress, **When** health check called on new version, **Then** returns healthy status only after database migrations complete and dependencies verified
4. **Given** shutdown signal sent to application, **When** graceful shutdown initiates, **Then** application stops accepting new requests, completes active requests within 30 seconds, closes database connections cleanly
5. **Given** shutdown taking longer than timeout, **When** grace period expires, **Then** application force terminates with log of incomplete requests for investigation

---

### User Story 7 - Centralized Logging and Log Aggregation (Priority: P3)

Operations team can search and analyze application logs across all containers and deployments from centralized dashboard. Logs are structured, searchable, and retained for 90 days for troubleshooting and compliance.

**Why this priority**: Centralized logging is essential for debugging production issues and understanding system behavior. However, basic logging to stdout works initially while centralized solution is implemented post-launch.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating test log messages in application, verifying logs appear in centralized dashboard within 1 minute, searching for specific log patterns, and filtering by severity level or timestamp.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application containers running in production, **When** logs generated, **Then** logs automatically forwarded to centralized logging system within 60 seconds
2. **Given** production issue occurring, **When** operations searches logs, **Then** can filter by container ID, severity level, timestamp, and search text patterns
3. **Given** error logged in application, **When** viewing in dashboard, **Then** log includes structured fields: timestamp, severity, service name, request ID, stack trace
4. **Given** 90 days of logs accumulated, **When** retention policy runs, **Then** logs older than 90 days automatically archived or purged per compliance requirements
5. **Given** high log volume during incident, **When** searching logs, **Then** dashboard returns results within 5 seconds for queries spanning last 24 hours

---

### User Story 8 - Horizontal Scaling for High Availability (Priority: P3)

Operations team can scale application horizontally by adding more instances to handle increased load. Load balancer distributes traffic across multiple instances with automatic failover if an instance becomes unhealthy.

**Why this priority**: Horizontal scaling provides high availability and handles traffic spikes. Important for growth but not required for initial launch with single instance serving initial user base.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying 3 application instances, verifying load balancer distributes requests evenly, simulating instance failure and confirming automatic failover to healthy instances with zero user-facing errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** single application instance running, **When** operations adds second instance, **Then** load balancer automatically detects new instance and begins routing 50% of traffic to it
2. **Given** 3 application instances serving traffic, **When** one instance fails health check, **Then** load balancer removes failed instance from rotation within 30 seconds
3. **Given** traffic spike occurring, **When** load increases 300%, **Then** operations can deploy additional instances and load balancer incorporates them automatically
4. **Given** multiple instances running, **When** deployment occurs, **Then** rolling deployment updates one instance at a time ensuring 2/3 capacity always available
5. **Given** database migration required, **When** deployment with migration runs, **Then** only one instance runs migration while others wait, preventing concurrent migration conflicts

  - Deployment pipeline includes locking mechanism allowing only one deployment at a time
  - Second deployment request queues until first completes
  - Dashboard shows queued deployment status and position
  - After 30 minutes, queued deployment expires to prevent stale deployments

- What happens when graceful shutdown timeout expires with active requests still processing?
  - Application logs list of incomplete requests with details (endpoint, duration, request ID)
  - Force termination proceeds to prevent blocking deployment indefinitely
  - Operations team alerted to investigate long-running requests
  - Load balancer already routed new traffic to other instances (zero user impact)

- How does system handle horizontal scaling with stateful sessions?
  - Session data stored in shared cache (Redis) accessible by all instances
  - No session affinity required - any instance can serve any user
  - Failed instance does not lose session data (preserved in shared cache)
  - If shared cache unavailable, sessions fall back to database with warning

## Assumptions

1. **Cloud Provider Infrastructure**: Specification assumes deployment to cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean) with managed container orchestration, load balancing, and persistent storage services available.

2. **GitHub as Code Repository**: CI/CD pipeline assumes GitHub as source control platform with GitHub Actions for automation. Alternative platforms (GitLab, Bitbucket) would require different workflow configuration.

3. **Let's Encrypt for SSL**: Free SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt assumed suitable for production. Alternative certificate authorities or wildcard certificates may be required for specific compliance needs.

4. **PostgreSQL as Production Database**: PostgreSQL chosen for production based on open-source licensing, strong ACID compliance, and JSON support for flexible schema. Alternative databases (MySQL, MongoDB) would require different migration approach.

5. **90-Day Log Retention**: Log retention period set at 90 days based on typical troubleshooting and compliance needs. Specific industries (healthcare, finance) may require longer retention.

6. **Single Geographic Region**: Initial deployment assumes single geographic region. Multi-region deployment for disaster recovery or latency optimization is out of scope for initial version.

7. **Redis for Session Storage**: Shared session storage assumes Redis or similar in-memory cache for stateless scaling. Alternative approaches (sticky sessions, database-backed sessions) are possible but not recommended.

8. **Standard HTTP/HTTPS Ports**: Deployment assumes standard ports 80/443 for HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Non-standard ports or additional protocols (WebSocket, gRPC) may require additional configuration.

9. **Docker as Containerization Platform**: Containers assume Docker format. Alternative runtimes (Podman, containerd) may work but are not explicitly tested.

10. **Daily Backup Schedule**: Database backups scheduled daily during low-traffic window. High-transaction applications may require more frequent backups or continuous replication.

## Dependencies

- **Container Registry**: Requires access to container registry (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, private registry) for storing and distributing container images
- **Cloud Provider Account**: Requires account with cloud provider offering container orchestration, managed databases, load balancing, and persistent storage
- **Domain Name**: Requires registered domain name with DNS management access for SSL certificate provisioning and routing configuration
- **Existing Application**: Depends on existing SignUpFlow application codebase being container-ready (no hardcoded file paths, configurable via environment variables)
- **GitHub Actions**: Requires GitHub Actions enabled for repository with sufficient build minutes quota for CI/CD pipelines
- **Monitoring Integration**: Integration points for external monitoring (Sentry, Uptime checks) depend on those services being provisioned separately

## Out of Scope

- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Geographic distribution across multiple data centers or regions not included in initial version
- **Auto-Scaling Policies**: Automated scaling based on metrics (CPU, memory, request rate) not included. Manual scaling supported but automatic triggers deferred.
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Advanced deployment strategies (blue-green, canary) not included. Rolling deployment is standard approach.
- **Disaster Recovery Site**: Full DR site in separate region with failover automation not included. Backup/restore provides recovery but not instant failover.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Full IaC implementation (Terraform, Pulumi) for reproducible infrastructure not included. Cloud provider console configuration acceptable initially.
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes or advanced orchestration platforms not required. Simpler container hosting (Docker Compose, Cloud Run, ECS Fargate) sufficient for initial scale.
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Distributed tracing, APM tools, custom metrics dashboards not included. Basic health checks and logging sufficient initially.
- **Database Replication**: PostgreSQL read replicas or multi-master replication not included. Single primary database sufficient for initial launch scale.
- **CDN Integration**: Content delivery network for static assets not included. Can be added post-launch for global latency optimization.
- **Secrets Management**: Dedicated secrets management service (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) not included. Environment variables sufficient for initial secrets.
