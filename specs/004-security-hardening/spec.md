# Feature Specification: Security Hardening & Compliance

**Feature Branch**: `004-security-hardening`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Security hardening and compliance features including rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks, comprehensive audit logging for all admin actions, CSRF protection for state-changing operations, session invalidation on password changes, two-factor authentication (2FA) via TOTP authenticator apps, security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options), input validation and sanitization across all endpoints, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, and secure password reset flow with time-limited tokens. Must integrate with existing JWT authentication system and maintain audit trail for compliance requirements."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Rate Limiting for Brute Force Prevention (Priority: P1)

System automatically detects and blocks excessive login attempts from same IP address or user account. After 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes, account is temporarily locked for 30 minutes with clear user messaging.

**Why this priority**: Brute force attacks are the most common authentication attack vector. Without rate limiting, attackers can make unlimited password guessing attempts. This is critical for production launch security.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting 6 failed logins from same IP within 2 minutes, verifying system blocks 6th attempt with "Too many failed attempts" message, and confirming successful login works after 30-minute lockout expires.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user with valid account, **When** 5 incorrect passwords entered within 15 minutes, **Then** 6th attempt blocked with "Account temporarily locked. Try again in 30 minutes" message
2. **Given** attacker using multiple IP addresses, **When** 100+ login attempts made across different IPs for same account, **Then** account locked after 5 failures regardless of IP
3. **Given** legitimate user locked out, **When** 30-minute lockout expires, **Then** user can successfully login with correct password
4. **Given** admin viewing security dashboard, **When** rate limit triggered, **Then** alert shows blocked IP, username, attempt count, and lockout expiration time
5. **Given** locked account, **When** user requests password reset, **Then** reset email sent and successful reset unlocks account immediately

### User Story 2 - Comprehensive Audit Logging (Priority: P1)

System records all admin actions including user modifications, role changes, event creation/deletion, and sensitive data access in immutable audit log. Logs include who, what, when, where (IP), and before/after states for compliance.

**Why this priority**: Audit trails are mandatory for compliance (SOC 2, GDPR) and security incident investigation. Without audit logging, unauthorized changes cannot be traced or proven. Critical for enterprise customers and legal protection.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by performing admin action (e.g., change user role from volunteer to admin), verifying audit log entry created with timestamp, admin user ID, action type, target user, old value (volunteer), new value (admin), and IP address.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin changes user role, **When** role updated from volunteer to admin, **Then** audit log records: timestamp, admin_user_id, action="role_change", target_user_id, old_value="volunteer", new_value="admin", ip_address
2. **Given** admin deletes event, **When** event removed, **Then** audit log records: timestamp, admin_user_id, action="event_delete", event_id, event_data_snapshot (JSON), ip_address
3. **Given** security incident occurs, **When** investigating suspicious activity, **Then** audit log searchable by user, action type, date range, and IP address
4. **Given** compliance audit requested, **When** exporting audit trail, **Then** complete immutable log exported as CSV with all required fields for 12-month retention period
5. **Given** audit log entry created, **When** attempting to modify or delete entry, **Then** operation fails - audit logs are append-only and immutable

---

### User Story 3 - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (Priority: P1)

Users can enable 2FA using TOTP authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy). After entering correct password, system prompts for 6-digit time-based code. Organization administrators can enforce mandatory 2FA for all users.

**Why this priority**: 2FA dramatically reduces account takeover risk even if passwords are compromised. Many enterprise customers require 2FA for security compliance. Essential for protecting sensitive volunteer and organizational data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by enabling 2FA in user settings, scanning QR code with Google Authenticator, logging out, logging back in with password + 6-digit code, and verifying access granted only when both factors correct.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user enabling 2FA, **When** navigating to security settings, **Then** QR code displayed with secret key and instructions for adding to authenticator app
2. **Given** 2FA enabled, **When** user logs in with correct password, **Then** system prompts for 6-digit TOTP code before granting access
3. **Given** 2FA prompt displayed, **When** incorrect code entered 3 times, **Then** login fails and user must restart authentication with password
4. **Given** user loses access to authenticator app, **When** requesting 2FA reset, **Then** admin can disable 2FA for account after verifying user identity
5. **Given** organization admin, **When** enabling mandatory 2FA policy, **Then** all users required to setup 2FA within 7 days or account access restricted

---

### User Story 4 - CSRF Protection (Priority: P2)

System validates CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE). Each user session has unique token that must be included in requests. Prevents attackers from tricking users into executing unwanted actions.

**Why this priority**: CSRF attacks exploit user authentication to perform unauthorized actions. Protection is security best practice but less critical than authentication hardening. Can be implemented shortly after launch.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making authenticated POST request without CSRF token and verifying 403 Forbidden response, then including valid token and confirming request succeeds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** authenticated user, **When** submitting form without CSRF token, **Then** request rejected with 403 Forbidden and error "CSRF token missing or invalid"
2. **Given** CSRF token generated for session, **When** token included in POST request header, **Then** request processed successfully
3. **Given** attacker crafting malicious link, **When** authenticated user clicks link attempting state change, **Then** request fails due to missing CSRF token
4. **Given** CSRF token expired (30-minute lifetime), **When** user submits old form, **Then** request rejected and user prompted to refresh page for new token
5. **Given** API request from external integration, **When** using service account credentials, **Then** CSRF validation bypassed for programmatic API access

---

### User Story 5 - Session Invalidation on Password Change (Priority: P2)

When user changes password, all active sessions across all devices are immediately invalidated except current session. User must re-authenticate on other devices. Prevents unauthorized access from stolen sessions after password compromise discovered.

**Why this priority**: Critical for security breach containment. If user suspects account compromise and changes password, all existing sessions must be terminated. Important security feature but not blocking launch.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in on two different browsers, changing password in browser A, and verifying browser B is immediately logged out and must re-authenticate with new password.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user logged in on desktop and mobile, **When** password changed on desktop, **Then** mobile session immediately invalidated and login screen displayed
2. **Given** password change completed, **When** user continues using current session, **Then** current session remains active without re-authentication required
3. **Given** multiple active sessions exist, **When** admin resets user password, **Then** all sessions for that user invalidated and user must login with new password
4. **Given** JWT tokens issued before password change, **When** user attempts API request with old token, **Then** token rejected as invalid due to password version mismatch
5. **Given** session invalidated due to password change, **When** user logs in with new password, **Then** new session created and user can access system normally

---

### User Story 6 - Security Headers and XSS Protection (Priority: P2)

System sends security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options) with every response. Content Security Policy blocks inline scripts preventing XSS attacks. HSTS enforces HTTPS connections.

**Why this priority**: Security headers provide defense-in-depth against common web vulnerabilities. CSP prevents XSS exploitation even if sanitization is bypassed. Important for security posture but less urgent than authentication hardening.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by inspecting HTTP response headers and verifying presence of: Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any HTTP response from application, **When** inspecting headers, **Then** HSTS header present with max-age=31536000 (1 year) enforcing HTTPS
2. **Given** application loaded in browser, **When** attempting to load inline JavaScript, **Then** CSP policy blocks execution and logs violation
3. **Given** attacker attempting clickjacking, **When** trying to embed application in iframe, **Then** X-Frame-Options: DENY prevents embedding
4. **Given** user submitting form with malicious script, **When** data rendered in UI, **Then** XSS attempt blocked by CSP and content sanitization
5. **Given** browser supporting CSP reporting, **When** CSP violation occurs, **Then** violation reported to security monitoring endpoint for analysis

---

### User Story 7 - Secure Password Reset Flow (Priority: P3)

Users can request password reset via email with time-limited token (valid 1 hour). Token is single-use, cryptographically secure, and invalidated after successful reset or expiration. Email includes clear instructions and security warnings.

**Why this priority**: Secure password reset prevents account takeover via password reset link interception or token guessing. Important for security but basic reset flow already exists - this enhances it. Can be improved post-launch.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting password reset, receiving email with unique token link, using link to set new password within 1 hour, and verifying token expires after use and cannot be reused.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user forgot password, **When** entering email on reset form, **Then** reset email sent with unique token link valid for 1 hour
2. **Given** reset email received, **When** clicking reset link within 1 hour, **Then** password reset form displayed allowing new password entry
3. **Given** password successfully reset, **When** attempting to use reset link again, **Then** link shows "This reset link has already been used" error
4. **Given** reset link generated, **When** 1 hour expires before use, **Then** link shows "This reset link has expired. Request a new one" error
5. **Given** multiple reset requests for same account, **When** latest reset link generated, **Then** all previous reset links invalidated immediately

### Edge Cases

- What happens when rate limiting triggers during legitimate high-traffic events?
  - Organization administrators can temporarily disable rate limiting for specific IP ranges (e.g., office network)
  - Rate limits automatically increased during known events (e.g., Sunday morning for churches)
  - Manual override available with audit log entry

- How does system handle 2FA when user loses phone with authenticator app?
  - User contacts support with identity verification
  - Admin can disable 2FA for account after verification
  - User required to re-enable 2FA after regaining access

- What happens when CSRF token expires during long form-fill session?
  - Form submission includes hidden token refresh mechanism
  - If token expired, user prompted to refresh page rather than losing data
  - Background token refresh every 15 minutes prevents expiration

- How does audit logging handle high-volume admin actions?
  - Async logging queue prevents performance degradation
  - Bulk operations logged as single entry with affected IDs list
  - Rate limiting on audit log queries prevents performance impact

- What happens when user changes password but has active API integrations?
  - API tokens (service accounts) separate from user passwords - unaffected by password changes
  - User sessions (web/mobile) invalidated, API tokens remain valid
  - User notified: "Your active sessions have been logged out. API integrations are not affected."

- **SC-010**: 2FA setup completion rate exceeds 90% when user initiates setup process (no abandonment)

## Assumptions

1. **TOTP Standard for 2FA**: Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) via RFC 6238 assumed adequate for 2FA needs. SMS-based 2FA not included due to security weaknesses and cost.

2. **12-Month Audit Retention**: Audit log retention period of 12 months based on typical compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR). Specific industries may require longer retention.

3. **Rate Limit Thresholds**: 5 failures per 15 minutes and 30-minute lockout based on industry best practices balancing security and usability. Adjustable per organization needs.

4. **Session Timeout Values**: 24-hour absolute timeout and 2-hour idle timeout based on standard web application security recommendations. May require adjustment for specific use cases.

5. **Password Strength Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements aligns with NIST guidelines. More stringent requirements (12+ characters) may be needed for high-security organizations.

6. **JWT for Session Management**: Existing JWT authentication system assumed suitable for session tracking with password version field. Alternative session stores (Redis, database) may be required for advanced features.

7. **Email for Password Reset**: Email-based password reset assumed secure for target users. High-security environments may require additional verification steps.

8. **Single Geographic Region**: Audit logs and rate limiting data stored in single region. Multi-region deployment may require log aggregation and distributed rate limiting.

9. **No Compliance Certifications**: Security hardening provides foundation for compliance but does not include formal SOC 2, ISO 27001, or HIPAA certification processes.

10. **Admin-Managed 2FA Recovery**: 2FA recovery requires admin intervention rather than automated recovery codes. Reduces attack surface but increases support burden.

## Dependencies

- **Existing JWT Authentication**: Security features extend existing JWT-based authentication system (must not break current authentication)
- **Email Service**: Password reset and security notifications depend on Feature 001 (email notification system)
- **Database**: Audit logging requires sufficient database storage and query performance for high-volume logs
- **Time Synchronization**: TOTP 2FA requires accurate server time (NTP synchronization) for code validation
- **HTTPS/TLS**: Security headers and CSRF protection assume HTTPS-only deployment (depends on Feature 003 infrastructure)

## Out of Scope

- **Biometric Authentication**: Fingerprint, face recognition not included in initial version
- **Hardware Security Keys**: U2F/WebAuthn hardware token support deferred to future iteration
- **Advanced Threat Detection**: Machine learning-based anomaly detection, behavioral analysis not included
- **Penetration Testing**: Professional security audit and penetration testing recommended but not included in feature scope
- **DDoS Protection**: Distributed denial-of-service mitigation handled at infrastructure level, not application level
- **Encryption at Rest**: Database encryption for stored data not included (may be required for certain compliance standards)
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restricting access to specific IP ranges not included in initial version
- **Custom Security Policies**: Per-organization security policy configuration deferred to enterprise tier
- **Security Incident Response Plan**: Formal incident response procedures and runbooks not included in technical specification
- **Third-Party Security Integrations**: Integration with SIEM tools, security information platforms not included initially
