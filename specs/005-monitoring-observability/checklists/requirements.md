# Specification Quality Checklist: Monitoring & Observability Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASS

All requirements focused on operational capabilities rather than implementation. While spec mentions Sentry as dependency (documented in Dependencies section), functional requirements remain technology-agnostic (e.g., "System MUST capture errors" not "Sentry SDK MUST capture errors"). User stories written from operations team perspective (appropriate for monitoring feature).

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASS

Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All 40 functional requirements testable and unambiguous. All 10 success criteria measurable with specific metrics (60-second detection, 99.9% uptime accuracy, 5-second log search). 7 user stories with 35 acceptance scenarios. 8 edge cases documented with detailed handling. 10 assumptions and 6 dependencies explicitly stated. 10 out-of-scope items clearly excluded.

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASS

Specification ready for technical planning. All user stories independently testable (can implement error tracking alone without uptime monitoring). Success criteria map to user stories with measurable outcomes. No implementation details leaked beyond necessary dependencies (Sentry, Slack).

## Notes

**All checklist items pass.** Specification complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Key Strengths:**
1. Operations team perspective appropriate for monitoring feature (ops team as users)
2. Comprehensive coverage: 7 user stories spanning error tracking, uptime, performance, logging, alerting, status, analysis
3. Clear prioritization: P1 (critical monitoring: error tracking, uptime, performance), P2 (operational excellence), P3 (optimization)
4. Measurable success criteria with specific performance targets (60s detection, 99.9% uptime, 5s log search)
5. Well-documented assumptions about monitoring infrastructure choices (Sentry SaaS, 90-day retention, Slack primary)
6. Edge cases cover real operational concerns (Sentry unreachable, alert fatigue, component failures, log volume spikes)

**Next Steps:** Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan.
