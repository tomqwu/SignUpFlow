# Feature Specification: Monitoring & Observability Platform

**Feature Branch**: `005-monitoring-observability`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Monitoring and observability platform with Sentry error tracking integration, uptime monitoring with health check endpoints, application performance metrics (response times, database query performance, memory usage), real-time error alerting via email and Slack, centralized metrics dashboard for operations team, log analysis and search capabilities, performance bottleneck identification, service health status page, and automated alerting rules for critical incidents. Must integrate with existing infrastructure logging and provide visibility into production system health."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Real-Time Error Tracking (Priority: P1)

Operations team receives immediate notifications when application errors occur, allowing them to respond before users report issues. Errors are automatically captured with full stack traces, user context, and environment details.

**Why this priority**: Critical for maintaining production system health. Without error tracking, teams operate blind to application failures until users complain, leading to poor user experience and reputation damage.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering an application error and verifying that Sentry captures the error, operations team receives notification within 60 seconds, and error details include stack trace and user context. Delivers immediate value by making hidden errors visible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application encounters unhandled exception, **When** error occurs in production, **Then** Sentry captures error with full stack trace, user ID, request details, and timestamp within 5 seconds
2. **Given** critical error threshold exceeded (3+ errors/minute), **When** error spike detected, **Then** operations team receives Slack alert and email notification within 60 seconds
3. **Given** error occurs in user workflow, **When** operations team views error in Sentry, **Then** error details include user journey breadcrumbs showing actions leading to error
4. **Given** recurring error pattern detected, **When** same error occurs 10+ times, **Then** Sentry groups errors and highlights as trending issue
5. **Given** error resolved by deployment, **When** new release deployed, **Then** Sentry marks related errors as resolved and tracks regression if error reoccurs

---

### User Story 2 - Uptime Monitoring (Priority: P1)

Operations team continuously monitors application availability to detect outages immediately. Health check endpoints provide detailed status of critical system components (database, API, authentication).

**Why this priority**: Essential for maintaining service reliability. Customers expect 99.9% uptime, and every minute of downtime costs revenue and trust. Early detection prevents minor issues from becoming major outages.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring health check endpoints, simulating component failures (database disconnect, API timeout), and verifying that monitoring system detects outage within 60 seconds and sends alerts. Delivers immediate value by providing uptime visibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** all system components healthy, **When** health check endpoint polled, **Then** endpoint returns 200 OK with status details for database, API, authentication service within 2 seconds
2. **Given** database connection fails, **When** health check detects failure, **Then** health endpoint returns 503 Service Unavailable and operations team receives critical alert within 60 seconds
3. **Given** application experiencing high latency, **When** health check detects response times >5 seconds, **Then** system sends warning alert to operations team
4. **Given** external monitoring service pings application, **When** health check requested every 60 seconds, **Then** monitoring system tracks uptime percentage and displays in dashboard
5. **Given** service recovered from outage, **When** health check passes 3 consecutive times, **Then** system sends recovery notification and updates status page

---

### User Story 3 - Performance Metrics Dashboard (Priority: P1)

Operations team views real-time application performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimize system resources. Metrics include API response times, database query performance, memory usage, and request throughput.

**Why this priority**: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction. Slow response times cause user abandonment. Operations team needs visibility into performance trends to prevent degradation before it affects users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating load on application, viewing metrics dashboard showing response times/memory/queries, and verifying metrics update within 60 seconds. Delivers immediate value by making performance visible and measurable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application processing user requests, **When** operations team views performance dashboard, **Then** dashboard displays average response time, P95 response time, requests per minute, error rate updated every 60 seconds
2. **Given** database query running slowly, **When** query exceeds 1 second duration, **Then** dashboard highlights slow query with execution time and query details
3. **Given** memory usage increasing, **When** memory usage exceeds 80% of available memory, **Then** dashboard shows warning indicator and memory usage trend chart
4. **Given** API endpoint experiencing high traffic, **When** operations team drills into endpoint metrics, **Then** dashboard shows per-endpoint response time distribution, error rates, and traffic volume
5. **Given** performance degradation detected, **When** response times increase 50% above baseline, **Then** system sends performance alert to operations team with affected endpoints

---

### User Story 4 - Log Analysis & Search (Priority: P2)

Operations team searches application logs to troubleshoot issues, trace user actions, and investigate security incidents. Logs are centralized, structured, and searchable with filtering by timestamp, user, action type, and severity.

**Why this priority**: Essential for debugging production issues. Developers need ability to search logs to understand what happened when error occurred. Security team needs logs for compliance and incident investigation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating application events, searching logs by user ID/timestamp/action, and verifying search returns relevant log entries within 5 seconds. Delivers immediate value by making logs searchable instead of requiring manual file parsing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application generating logs, **When** operations team searches logs by user ID, **Then** search returns all log entries for that user within 5 seconds, sorted by timestamp
2. **Given** error occurred at specific time, **When** operations team searches logs by timestamp range, **Then** search returns all log entries in that timeframe with filtering by severity (error, warning, info)
3. **Given** investigating failed login attempts, **When** operations team filters logs by action type "login" and result "failure", **Then** search returns all failed login attempts with IP address, timestamp, and reason
4. **Given** troubleshooting user issue, **When** operations team views user's log timeline, **Then** logs display in chronological order showing all user actions and system responses
5. **Given** security audit required, **When** operations team exports logs, **Then** system exports logs in structured JSON format with all required compliance fields

---

### User Story 5 - Automated Alerting Rules (Priority: P2)

Operations team configures custom alerting rules for critical events (error spikes, performance degradation, security incidents). Alerts route to appropriate team channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty) based on severity and incident type.

**Why this priority**: Proactive alerting prevents small issues from becoming crises. Different incidents require different response teams and urgency levels. Automated alerting ensures right people notified at right time.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring alerting rule for error rate threshold, triggering errors to exceed threshold, and verifying alert sent to configured channel within specified timeframe. Delivers immediate value by automating incident response.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** operations team creates alerting rule, **When** error rate exceeds 10 errors/minute for 5 minutes, **Then** system sends critical alert to on-call engineer via Slack and email
2. **Given** alerting rule configured for API response time, **When** P95 response time exceeds 3 seconds for 10 minutes, **Then** system sends warning alert to engineering team Slack channel
3. **Given** database connection pool exhausted, **When** connection pool usage exceeds 90%, **Then** system sends immediate alert to database team
4. **Given** multiple alerts firing simultaneously, **When** error spike and high memory usage occur together, **Then** system groups related alerts and sends single consolidated notification
5. **Given** alert resolved automatically, **When** error rate returns to normal levels, **Then** system sends resolution notification and marks incident as resolved

---

### User Story 6 - Service Health Status Page (Priority: P2)

Customers and internal teams view public status page showing current system health, ongoing incidents, and maintenance windows. Status page provides transparency during outages and reduces support ticket volume.

**Why this priority**: Reduces support burden by providing self-service status information. Customers appreciate transparency during incidents. Internal teams need single source of truth for system health.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing status page, simulating component failure, and verifying status page updates to show degraded service within 5 minutes. Delivers immediate value by reducing "is it down?" support tickets.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** all services operational, **When** user visits status page, **Then** status page displays "All Systems Operational" with green indicators for all components
2. **Given** database experiencing issues, **When** health check detects database failure, **Then** status page automatically updates to show "Database - Degraded Performance" within 5 minutes
3. **Given** planned maintenance scheduled, **When** operations team creates maintenance window, **Then** status page displays maintenance notice 24 hours in advance with expected downtime
4. **Given** incident occurring, **When** operations team posts incident update, **Then** status page shows incident timeline with updates and estimated resolution time
5. **Given** service recovered, **When** all components healthy, **Then** status page updates to "All Systems Operational" and displays incident post-mortem

---

### User Story 7 - Performance Bottleneck Identification (Priority: P3)

Operations team uses automated performance analysis to identify system bottlenecks before they impact users. System highlights slow database queries, inefficient API endpoints, and resource-intensive operations.

**Why this priority**: Proactive performance optimization prevents future issues. Identifying bottlenecks early is cheaper than fixing production performance crises. Helps prioritize engineering optimization work.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running performance analysis tool, generating load on known slow endpoint, and verifying system identifies endpoint as bottleneck with actionable recommendations. Delivers immediate value by highlighting optimization opportunities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application under normal load, **When** performance analysis runs, **Then** system identifies top 10 slowest API endpoints with average response time, P95 time, and request volume
2. **Given** database queries being monitored, **When** analysis detects query taking >1 second consistently, **Then** system highlights query as bottleneck with execution plan and optimization suggestions
3. **Given** memory usage growing over time, **When** analysis detects memory leak pattern, **Then** system alerts operations team with memory usage trend and suspected code locations
4. **Given** comparing performance across deployments, **When** operations team views performance comparison, **Then** system shows performance improvements/regressions for each deployment with affected endpoints
5. **Given** capacity planning needed, **When** operations team reviews performance trends, **Then** system projects resource usage growth and estimates when scaling needed

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when Sentry service is unreachable?** System queues error reports locally and retries sending with exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min). After 1 hour of failures, system logs to local error file and sends alert to operations team about monitoring system degradation.

- **How does system handle alert fatigue from high-frequency alerts?** System implements alert throttling: if same alert triggers >5 times in 15 minutes, system sends single consolidated alert with count and suppresses further alerts for 30 minutes. Operations team can adjust thresholds per alert type.

- **What happens when multiple components fail simultaneously?** System prioritizes alerts by severity (critical > warning > info) and dependencies (database failure before API errors caused by database). Status page shows highest-severity incident first with grouped related incidents.

- **How does system handle log volume during traffic spikes?** System implements dynamic log sampling during high-traffic periods: maintains 100% sampling for errors and warnings, reduces info-level logs to 10% sample when log volume exceeds 10,000 logs/minute. All sampled logs tagged with sampling rate for accurate analysis.

- **What happens when health check itself fails or times out?** System has redundant health check paths: primary health endpoint and backup simplified health endpoint. If primary fails to respond within 5 seconds, monitoring switches to backup. If both fail, monitoring assumes outage and sends critical alert.

- **How does system handle timezone differences in log timestamps?** All timestamps stored in UTC internally. Dashboard displays timestamps in user's local timezone with timezone indicator. Log export includes both UTC and local timezone for compliance.

- **What happens when alerting channel (Slack/email) is down?** System attempts delivery through all configured channels. If Slack fails, sends email. If email fails, falls back to SMS (if configured). System logs all delivery failures for audit trail.

- **How does system handle false positive alerts?** Operations team can snooze specific alerts for configurable duration (1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours). System tracks snooze patterns and suggests adjusting alert thresholds if alert snoozed repeatedly.

## Assumptions

1. **Sentry SaaS Platform**: We assume Sentry cloud service for error tracking rather than self-hosted Sentry instance. Rationale: SaaS eliminates operational burden of running monitoring infrastructure. If compliance requires self-hosted, deployment plan must include Sentry infrastructure setup.

2. **Health Check Endpoint Design**: We assume single unified health check endpoint that validates all critical dependencies rather than per-component endpoints. Rationale: Simplifies monitoring configuration and reduces polling overhead. Can add granular endpoints later if needed for debugging.

3. **Log Retention Period**: We assume 90-day log retention is sufficient for troubleshooting and compliance. Rationale: Most production issues investigated within 30 days. Compliance typically requires 90 days for financial/healthcare industries. Can extend if specific industry requires longer retention.

4. **Alerting Channel Priority**: We assume Slack as primary alerting channel with email as fallback. Rationale: Most engineering teams use Slack for real-time communication. Email used as backup when Slack unavailable. PagerDuty integration optional for teams requiring on-call escalation.

5. **Performance Metrics Resolution**: We assume 60-second metric resolution is sufficient for operations visibility. Rationale: Balances real-time visibility with infrastructure cost. Can increase resolution to 10-second intervals for critical metrics if needed for debugging acute incidents.

6. **Status Page Hosting**: We assume status page hosted on separate infrastructure from main application to ensure availability during application outages. Rationale: Status page must remain accessible when main application down. Use static site hosting or third-party status page service.

7. **Database Query Monitoring**: We assume ability to monitor database queries through ORM instrumentation or database slow query logs. Rationale: Requires database-specific configuration or ORM-level query tracking. May need different approach for databases without slow query log support.

8. **Alert Threshold Defaults**: We assume default alert thresholds (error rate >10/min, response time >5sec) based on industry standards. Rationale: Provides sensible starting point. Operations team will tune thresholds based on application baseline performance and traffic patterns.

9. **Timezone Handling**: We assume all internal timestamps stored in UTC with timezone conversion only at display layer. Rationale: Eliminates timezone ambiguity in log analysis and simplifies distributed system debugging. Users see timestamps in local timezone with UTC offset displayed.

10. **Monitoring Cost Budget**: We assume monitoring infrastructure cost <5% of total application infrastructure cost. Rationale: Monitoring is essential but shouldn't be primary cost driver. Requires log sampling, metric aggregation, and retention policies to control costs at scale.

## Dependencies

1. **Sentry Account & API Keys**: Requires Sentry account with appropriate plan tier supporting project error volume. Dependency: Must provision Sentry account and obtain DSN (Data Source Name) before deployment.

2. **Existing Infrastructure Logging**: Feature integrates with infrastructure logging implemented in Feature 003 (Production Infrastructure). Dependency: Feature 003 must implement structured JSON logging that monitoring system can ingest.

3. **Health Check Endpoint Implementation**: Requires implementation of health check endpoint that validates database connectivity, API availability, authentication service status. Dependency: Application must implement health check logic before monitoring can verify system health.

4. **Slack Workspace & Webhook**: Requires Slack workspace access and incoming webhook configuration for alert delivery. Dependency: Operations team must create Slack channel and configure webhook URL before alert delivery functional.

5. **Metrics Collection Infrastructure**: Requires infrastructure for collecting and aggregating performance metrics (response times, database queries, resource usage). Dependency: May require APM (Application Performance Monitoring) agent or custom instrumentation.

6. **Status Page Hosting**: Requires separate hosting infrastructure for status page to ensure availability during application outages. Dependency: May use third-party service (StatusPage.io) or static site hosting separate from main application infrastructure.

## Out of Scope

1. **Distributed Tracing**: Full distributed tracing across microservices (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) excluded. Feature focuses on monolithic application monitoring. Distributed tracing can be added in future if application evolves to microservices architecture.

2. **Custom Metrics & Dashboards**: User-defined custom metrics and personalized dashboards excluded from initial scope. Feature provides standard operational metrics. Custom metric collection and dashboard builder can be added based on user feedback.

3. **Machine Learning Anomaly Detection**: AI/ML-powered anomaly detection (predicting incidents before they occur, automatic root cause analysis) excluded. Feature uses threshold-based alerting. ML features can be added in future iterations.

4. **Synthetic Monitoring**: Simulated user transactions and proactive testing excluded. Feature focuses on real user monitoring (RUM) and system health. Synthetic monitoring can be added for proactive issue detection.

5. **Infrastructure Monitoring (Servers, Containers)**: Server CPU/memory, container orchestration metrics, network monitoring excluded. Feature focuses on application-level monitoring. Infrastructure monitoring handled by separate tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog).

6. **Third-Party Service Monitoring**: Monitoring of external dependencies (payment processors, email providers, SMS gateways) excluded from initial scope. Feature monitors SignUpFlow application only. External service monitoring can be added for comprehensive visibility.

7. **Audit Logging for Compliance**: Comprehensive audit logging for SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR compliance excluded. Feature implements operational logging only. Compliance audit logging addressed separately in Feature 004 (Security Hardening).

8. **Mobile App Monitoring**: Mobile application error tracking, crash reporting, performance monitoring excluded. Feature focuses on web application monitoring. Mobile monitoring requires separate SDKs and implementation.

9. **User Session Replay**: Video replay of user sessions to reproduce bugs excluded due to privacy concerns and storage costs. Feature captures error context through breadcrumbs only. Session replay can be added with appropriate privacy controls if needed.

10. **Cost Monitoring & Optimization**: Cloud infrastructure cost monitoring and optimization recommendations excluded. Feature focuses on performance and reliability monitoring. Cost monitoring can be added as separate feature if needed for SaaS cost management.
