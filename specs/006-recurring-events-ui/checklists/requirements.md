# Specification Quality Checklist: Recurring Events User Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASS

All requirements focused on user interactions and business outcomes. Spec mentions calendar library as dependency (documented in Dependencies section) but functional requirements remain technology-agnostic (e.g., "System MUST display visual calendar preview" not "FullCalendar component MUST render"). User stories written from admin user perspective.

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASS

Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All 38 functional requirements testable and unambiguous. All 10 success criteria measurable with specific metrics (2-minute creation, 90% time reduction, 95% error prevention). 7 user stories with 35 acceptance scenarios. 8 edge cases documented with detailed handling (DST, 5th Sunday, deletions, past edits). 10 assumptions and 5 dependencies explicitly stated. 10 out-of-scope items clearly excluded.

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASS

Specification ready for technical planning. All user stories independently testable (can implement weekly recurrence alone without monthly patterns). Success criteria map to user stories with measurable outcomes. No implementation details leaked beyond necessary dependencies (calendar component, date utilities).

## Notes

**All checklist items pass.** Specification complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Key Strengths:**
1. Admin user perspective with clear focus on reducing manual event creation burden
2. Comprehensive coverage: 7 user stories spanning weekly, single/series editing, preview, monthly, biweekly, bulk edit, holidays
3. Clear prioritization: P1 (core patterns: weekly, editing, preview), P2 (advanced patterns, bulk edit), P3 (quality of life)
4. Measurable success criteria with specific time/percentage targets (2min creation, 90% reduction, 95% error prevention)
5. Well-documented assumptions about series duration (2 years), timezone handling, historical preservation
6. Edge cases cover real-world complexities (DST, 5th Sunday, deletions, timezone changes)

**Next Steps:** Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan.
