# Specification Quality Checklist: Manual Schedule Editing Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASS

Requirements focused on admin interactions and scheduling outcomes. Drag-and-drop library mentioned as dependency (documented appropriately) but requirements remain technology-agnostic ("System MUST support drag-and-drop" not "react-beautiful-dnd MUST enable dragging").

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASS

Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All 35 functional requirements testable. All 10 success criteria measurable (3min adjustments, 500ms validation, 100% lock reliability). 6 user stories with 30 acceptance scenarios. 7 edge cases documented. 10 assumptions and 5 dependencies stated. 10 out-of-scope items excluded.

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASS

Specification ready for planning. All user stories independently testable. Success criteria map to measurable outcomes. No implementation leaks beyond necessary dependencies.

## Notes

**All checklist items pass.** Ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Next Steps:** Proceed to technical implementation planning.
