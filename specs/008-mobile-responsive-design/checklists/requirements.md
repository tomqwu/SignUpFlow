# Specification Quality Checklist: Mobile Responsive Design

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASS

All requirements focused on user experience and mobile usability rather than implementation. Spec mentions specific technologies (PWA, service workers, iOS/Android) only as dependencies or named conventions (iOS Calendar, Android Chrome), not implementation prescriptions. Functional requirements remain technology-agnostic (e.g., "System MUST display content within 3 seconds" not "React components MUST load...").

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASS

Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All 46 functional requirements testable and unambiguous. All 10 success criteria measurable with specific metrics. 8 user stories with 40 acceptance scenarios. 8 edge cases documented. 10 assumptions and 5 dependencies explicitly stated. 10 out-of-scope items clearly excluded.

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASS

Specification ready for technical planning. All user stories independently testable. Success criteria map to user stories with measurable outcomes. No implementation details leaked beyond necessary dependencies.

## Notes

**All checklist items pass.** Specification complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Key Strengths:**
1. Strong focus on volunteer mobile use cases (view schedule, mark availability) vs admin features
2. Comprehensive coverage: 8 user stories spanning responsive layout, touch controls, navigation, offline, performance, native integration, accessibility
3. Clear prioritization: P1 (core mobile access), P2 (enhanced experience), P3 (platform integration)
4. Measurable success criteria with specific performance targets (3s load, 60fps, 90% touch accuracy)
5. Well-documented platform assumptions (iOS 15+, Android 10+, PWA support)

**Next Steps:** Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan.
