# Specification Quality Checklist: SMS Notifications

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASS

All requirements focused on SMS communication value and regulatory compliance rather than implementation. Spec mentions Twilio only as a named dependency with justification, not implementation prescription. Functional requirements remain technology-agnostic (e.g., "System MUST send SMS within 5 minutes" not "Twilio API MUST...").

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASS

Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All 45 functional requirements testable and unambiguous. All 10 success criteria measurable with specific metrics. 7 user stories with 35 acceptance scenarios. 8 edge cases documented. 10 assumptions and 5 dependencies explicitly stated. 10 out-of-scope items clearly excluded.

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASS

Specification ready for technical planning. All user stories independently testable. Success criteria map to user stories with measurable outcomes (98% open rate, 30% attendance improvement). No implementation details leaked beyond necessary dependencies.

## Notes

**All checklist items pass.** Specification complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Key Strengths:**
1. Strong focus on regulatory compliance (TCPA, opt-in/opt-out) as P1 priority
2. Comprehensive coverage: 7 user stories spanning reminders, opt-in, broadcast, change notifications, cost management, opt-out, templates
3. Clear prioritization: P1 (core SMS + compliance), P2 (broadcast + cost control), P3 (templates)
4. Measurable success criteria with specific targets (98% open rate, 30% attendance improvement, 80% opt-in completion)
5. Well-documented compliance requirements (double opt-in, STOP keyword, audit trail, quiet hours)

**Next Steps:** Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan.
