# Specification Quality Checklist: User Onboarding System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASS

All requirements focused on user experience and activation rather than implementation. Spec mentions YouTube/Vimeo only as dependencies, not implementation details. Functional requirements remain technology-agnostic (e.g., "System MUST display wizard" not "React component MUST render...").

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASS

Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All 40 functional requirements testable and unambiguous. All 10 success criteria measurable with specific metrics. 7 user stories with 35 acceptance scenarios. 8 edge cases documented. 10 assumptions and 5 dependencies explicitly stated. 10 out-of-scope items clearly excluded.

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASS

Specification ready for technical planning. All user stories independently testable. Success criteria map to user stories with measurable outcomes (70% completion rate, 30min time-to-value, 40% support ticket reduction). No implementation details leaked beyond necessary dependencies.

## Notes

**All checklist items pass.** Specification complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Key Strengths:**
1. Strong focus on activation and time-to-first-value metrics
2. Comprehensive coverage: 7 user stories spanning wizard, sample data, checklist, tutorials, progressive disclosure, dashboard, skip option
3. Clear prioritization: P1 (core activation), P2 (engagement enhancements), P3 (experienced user flexibility)
4. Measurable success criteria with specific targets (70% completion, 30min time-to-value, 25% retention improvement)
5. Well-documented user psychology principles (progressive disclosure, celebration moments, checklist motivation)

**Next Steps:** Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan.
