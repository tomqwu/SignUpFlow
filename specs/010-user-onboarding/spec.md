# Feature Specification: User Onboarding System

**Feature Branch**: `010-user-onboarding`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "User onboarding system for new organizations..."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Guided Setup Wizard (Priority: P1)

New organization administrators complete step-by-step setup wizard after account creation. Wizard guides through: organization profile (name, location, timezone), first event creation, first team setup, and volunteer invitation. Progress indicator shows current step and completion percentage. Can save progress and resume later.

**Why this priority**: Critical first impression. Poor onboarding causes 40-60% of new users to abandon SaaS products within first week. Guided wizard reduces time-to-first-value from hours to minutes, directly impacting activation and retention rates.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating new organization account, completing wizard steps, and verifying data saved correctly. Delivers immediate value of functional organization setup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new admin creates account, **When** they complete signup, **Then** wizard displays with Step 1/4: Organization Profile showing name, location, timezone fields and Continue button
2. **Given** admin on Step 1, **When** they enter organization name "First Church", location "Seattle, WA", timezone "America/Los_Angeles" and click Continue, **Then** wizard advances to Step 2/4: First Event with progress bar showing 25% complete
3. **Given** admin on Step 2, **When** they create event "Sunday Service" with date/time, **Then** event saved and wizard advances to Step 3/4: First Team
4. **Given** admin on Step 4 (Invite Volunteers), **When** they enter 3 email addresses and click Send Invites, **Then** invitations sent, wizard shows completion "Setup Complete!" with green checkmark and Continue to Dashboard button
5. **Given** admin exits wizard mid-flow (Step 2/4), **When** they log in again, **Then** wizard resumes at Step 2 with previous data preserved and option to "Start Over" or Continue

---

### User Story 2 - Sample Data Exploration (Priority: P1)

New administrators generate sample data (example events, teams, volunteers, schedules) to explore features without manual data entry. Sample data clearly marked with "SAMPLE" badges, includes realistic scenarios (church services, team roles, volunteer assignments), and can be deleted with single "Clear Sample Data" action.

**Why this priority**: Learning by doing is more effective than reading documentation. Sample data allows admins to immediately test scheduling solver, view reports, and understand workflows. Reduces learning curve from days to hours by providing working examples.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking "Generate Sample Data" button, exploring features with sample data, and verifying "Clear Sample Data" removes all sample records. Delivers hands-on learning environment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin in empty organization, **When** they click "Generate Sample Data" in onboarding dashboard, **Then** system creates 5 sample events, 3 sample teams, 10 sample volunteers, and 1 sample schedule
2. **Given** sample data generated, **When** admin views events list, **Then** sample events display with "SAMPLE" badge in gray color next to event name
3. **Given** admin explores sample schedule, **When** they view schedule, **Then** realistic volunteer assignments display showing balanced distribution across events
4. **Given** admin ready for real data, **When** they click "Clear Sample Data" button, **Then** confirmation dialog displays "Delete all sample events, teams, and volunteers?" with Delete/Cancel options
5. **Given** admin confirms sample data deletion, **When** deletion completes, **Then** all sample records removed, success message displays "Sample data cleared. Ready to add your real data!", and dashboard shows empty state

---

### User Story 3 - Getting Started Checklist (Priority: P1)

Administrators see checklist of essential setup tasks with progress tracking. Checklist includes: Complete Profile (0/1), Create First Event (0/1), Add Team (0/1), Invite Volunteers (0/3), Run First Schedule (0/1), View Reports (0/1). Completed items show green checkmark. Clicking checklist item navigates to relevant section.

**Why this priority**: Clear goals reduce anxiety and increase completion rates. Checklist provides visible progress, motivates continued engagement through completion satisfaction, and ensures admins don't miss critical setup steps. Industry standard for SaaS onboarding.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing checklist items and verifying checkmarks appear, progress percentage updates, and clicking items navigates correctly. Delivers progress visibility and guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new organization setup, **When** admin views dashboard, **Then** checklist widget displays with "Getting Started: 0/6 Complete (0%)" header and 6 unchecked items
2. **Given** admin completes organization profile, **When** profile saved, **Then** checklist updates "Complete Profile âœ“" with green checkmark and progress shows "1/6 Complete (17%)"
3. **Given** admin creates first event, **When** event saved, **Then** checklist updates "Create First Event âœ“" and progress shows "2/6 Complete (33%)"
4. **Given** admin invites 3 volunteers, **When** invitations sent, **Then** checklist updates "Invite Volunteers (3/3) âœ“" showing count of invitations
5. **Given** admin completes all 6 items, **When** last item checked, **Then** checklist displays "Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰ 6/6 (100%)" with celebration animation and "Hide Checklist" option

---

### User Story 4 - Interactive Tutorials (Priority: P2)

First-time users see contextual tooltips and walkthrough overlays explaining key features. Tooltips appear on first interaction with feature (schedule creation, team management, solver). Tutorials use highlight overlays, arrow pointers, and step-by-step instructions. Can dismiss tutorials or replay from Help menu.

**Why this priority**: Reduces support burden by preemptively answering common questions. Contextual learning (just-in-time education) more effective than upfront training. Improves feature adoption by reducing intimidation of complex features like scheduling solver.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering tutorial on first feature use, completing tutorial steps, dismissing tutorial, and replaying from Help menu. Delivers in-context feature education.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin first opens schedule creation, **When** page loads, **Then** overlay displays with spotlight on "Create Event" button, tooltip "Let's create your first event", and Next button
2. **Given** tutorial active, **When** admin clicks Next, **Then** spotlight moves to date picker with tooltip "Choose when your event occurs" and progress indicator "Step 2/5"
3. **Given** admin completes tutorial, **When** final step shown, **Then** overlay displays "Great job! You're ready to create events" with "Got it" button and option "Don't show this again"
4. **Given** tutorial dismissed, **When** admin revisits feature, **Then** tutorial doesn't auto-play, but Help icon appears in top-right showing "Replay Tutorial" option
5. **Given** admin stuck on feature, **When** they click Help > Tutorials, **Then** list displays all available tutorials: "Creating Events", "Managing Teams", "Running Solver", "Inviting Volunteers" with Replay buttons

### User Story 5 - Progressive Feature Disclosure (Priority: P2)

Advanced features (recurring events, manual schedule editing, SMS notifications) hidden initially, revealed after basic features mastered. Unlock conditions: recurring events after 3 events created, manual editing after first solver run, SMS after 5 volunteers invited. Unlock notifications celebrate achievement with explanation of new feature.

**Why this priority**: Prevents overwhelming new users with advanced features. Progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load, allows focus on core workflows first, and creates sense of achievement through feature unlocks. Increases long-term engagement and feature adoption.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by meeting unlock conditions and verifying features appear with unlock notifications. Delivers gradual complexity increase.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new organization, **When** admin views event creation, **Then** "Recurring Events" option hidden, standard event creation only visible
2. **Given** admin creates 3rd event, **When** event saved, **Then** notification displays "ðŸŽ‰ New Feature Unlocked: Recurring Events! Create weekly or monthly repeating events. Click to learn more"
3. **Given** recurring events unlocked, **When** admin views event creation, **Then** "Make this recurring?" checkbox now visible with tooltip "New! Create repeating events"
4. **Given** admin runs first solver, **When** schedule generated, **Then** notification displays "ðŸŽ‰ Manual Editing Unlocked! Drag-and-drop to adjust assignments. Click to see tutorial"
5. **Given** admin invites 5th volunteer, **When** invitation sent, **Then** notification displays "ðŸŽ‰ SMS Notifications Available! Reach volunteers via text. Set up in Settings > Notifications"

---

### User Story 6 - Onboarding Dashboard (Priority: P2)

Dedicated onboarding dashboard shows next actions, quick start videos, and documentation links. Next Actions section highlights most important incomplete tasks. Videos section offers 2-3 minute tutorials for key workflows. Resources section links to documentation, FAQ, and support contact.

**Why this priority**: Centralized guidance reduces search time for help resources. Video tutorials accommodate visual learners and demonstrate workflows better than text. Persistent access to onboarding resources supports self-service learning reducing support load.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing dashboard, playing videos, clicking documentation links, and verifying recommendations update as tasks complete. Delivers self-service learning hub.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin with 2/6 checklist items complete, **When** they view onboarding dashboard, **Then** "Next Actions" panel shows top 3 priority tasks: "Create your first team", "Invite 3 volunteers", "Run your first schedule"
2. **Given** admin on dashboard, **When** they view Videos section, **Then** 4 video cards display with thumbnails, titles, durations: "Getting Started (2:30)", "Creating Events (3:15)", "Managing Volunteers (2:45)", "Running Solver (3:00)"
3. **Given** admin clicks video, **When** video player opens, **Then** embedded video plays with controls, progress bar, and "Mark as Watched" button
4. **Given** admin watches video to end, **When** video completes, **Then** system automatically marks as watched, shows next video recommendation, and updates "4 videos watched" counter
5. **Given** admin needs help, **When** they view Resources section, **Then** links display: "Documentation", "FAQ (20 articles)", "Schedule Onboarding Call", "Contact Support (chat/email)" with appropriate icons

---

### User Story 7 - Skip Onboarding Option (Priority: P3)

Experienced administrators skip guided onboarding and access full feature set immediately. Skip option available on wizard first screen "Skip setup - I'm familiar with scheduling tools". Confirmation dialog explains skipping bypasses tutorials and sample data. Can re-enable onboarding from Settings.

**Why this priority**: Respects experienced users' time. Forcing onboarding on knowledgeable users creates friction and annoyance. Skip option improves satisfaction for users migrating from competitor products or setting up multiple organizations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking Skip, confirming action, accessing full features, and re-enabling onboarding from Settings. Delivers flexibility for experienced users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** wizard displays for new organization, **When** admin views Step 1, **Then** "Skip Setup" link appears at bottom in subtle styling
2. **Given** admin clicks Skip Setup, **When** confirmation dialog opens, **Then** message displays "Are you sure? Skipping will give full access but no guided tours or sample data. You can re-enable onboarding in Settings"
3. **Given** admin confirms skip, **When** dialog closed, **Then** full application interface displays, checklist hidden, tutorials disabled, and settings show "Enable Onboarding" toggle
4. **Given** admin skipped onboarding, **When** they enable onboarding in Settings, **Then** onboarding dashboard reappears, checklist shows based on current progress, and tutorials re-enable
5. **Given** admin skipped onboarding, **When** they complete organic actions (create event, add team), **Then** checklist retroactively updates showing completed items

### Edge Cases

- **Mid-Flow Browser Close**: What if admin closes browser during wizard Step 2/4? System must save progress automatically, restore wizard state on next login, and show "Resume Setup" or "Start Over" options.

- **Sample Data Conflicts**: What if admin generates sample data, creates real data, then clears samples? System must only delete records with "sample" flag, preserve all user-created data, and show confirmation "3 sample events deleted, 2 real events preserved".

- **Checklist Item Order**: What if admin completes items out of order (invites volunteers before creating events)? Checklist must accept any completion order, check items as completed regardless of sequence, and update progress correctly.

- **Feature Unlock While Locked Feature Open**: What if admin has event creation form open when 3rd event threshold unlocks recurring events? UI must dynamically reveal "Make recurring?" option without page refresh, show brief highlight animation on new option.

- **Multiple Admins Same Organization**: What if organization has 2 admins at different onboarding stages? System must track onboarding progress per user, allow independent completion of checklist, and avoid showing completed tutorials to second admin who wants them.

- **Onboarding After Organization Active**: What if admin enables onboarding after 6 months of active use? Checklist must show all items as complete based on existing data, tutorials available but not auto-triggered, and dashboard adapts to experienced user context.

- **Video Playback Failure**: What if embedded videos fail to load (network issue, hosting down)? System must show fallback "Video unavailable. View on YouTube" link, provide text alternative of video content, and track playback failures for technical team.

- **Language Preference Mid-Onboarding**: What if admin switches language from English to Spanish during wizard? System must immediately translate all onboarding content, preserve progress, and resume at same wizard step in new language.

## Assumptions

1. **First-Time SaaS Users**: Assumes many administrators are first-time SaaS users requiring detailed guidance. Rationale: Churches and small non-profits often have limited technical experience.

2. **Desktop Primary**: Assumes onboarding primarily accessed on desktop browsers, mobile onboarding adapted with simplified flows. Rationale: Initial setup requires more screen space and typing.

3. **Video Hosting**: Assumes video tutorials hosted on YouTube/Vimeo with embedding, not self-hosted. Rationale: Reduces bandwidth costs and leverages platform reliability.

4. **English First**: Assumes initial onboarding content in English, Spanish translation as Phase 2. Rationale: Focus resources on single language for faster launch.

5. **Single Admin Initially**: Assumes one administrator completes onboarding, additional admins added later. Rationale: Most organizations have single point person for initial setup.

6. **Sample Data Acceptance**: Assumes administrators understand sample data is fake and requires deletion. Rationale: Clear "SAMPLE" badges and deletion prompts prevent confusion.

7. **Tutorial Dismissal**: Assumes power users will dismiss tutorials early, casual users will complete them. Rationale: Provide option respects all user preferences.

8. **Progressive Disclosure Timing**: Assumes unlock thresholds (3 events, 5 volunteers) appropriate for majority. Rationale: Based on industry benchmarks for feature introduction timing.

9. **Analytics Privacy**: Assumes aggregate analytics acceptable, no PII tracking beyond org-level metrics. Rationale: Respects privacy while enabling product optimization.

10. **Help Content Maintenance**: Assumes onboarding content requires quarterly updates as product evolves. Rationale: Tutorials must stay synchronized with UI changes.

## Dependencies

1. **Email System**: Onboarding requires email for wizard progress notifications, milestone celebrations, and follow-up engagement
2. **Video Hosting Platform**: Requires YouTube/Vimeo account for hosting tutorial videos with embed permissions
3. **Analytics Platform**: Depends on analytics tracking infrastructure for measuring completion rates and drop-off points
4. **User Profile System**: Requires user-level preference storage for onboarding progress, tutorial completion, and feature unlocks
5. **Sample Data Generator**: Requires realistic sample data generation with proper database seeding and cleanup capabilities

## Out of Scope

1. **Live Chat Support**: In-app chat referenced but implementation out of scope; links to external support chat or email
2. **Scheduled Onboarding Calls**: "Schedule Call" links to calendar booking system, actual call delivery handled externally
3. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Basic metrics only; detailed funnel analysis, cohort tracking, A/B testing out of scope
4. **Gamification Elements**: Simple celebration moments only; points, badges, leaderboards, rewards programs not included
5. **Personalized Onboarding Paths**: Single onboarding flow for all; role-based or industry-specific customization out of scope
6. **Interactive Product Tours**: Overlay tutorials only; complex interactive simulations or sandbox environments not included
7. **Community Features**: Self-service help only; user forums, community Q&A, peer support out of scope
