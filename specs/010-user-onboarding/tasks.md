# Tasks: User Onboarding System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-user-onboarding/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Tests**: E2E tests requested in plan.md Constitution Check

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `api/` (backend), `frontend/` (frontend)
- Paths based on plan.md structure (SignUpFlow architecture)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and onboarding infrastructure

- [X] T001 Create OnboardingProgress model in api/models.py with fields: user_id, org_id, wizard_step_completed (int), checklist_state (JSON), tutorials_completed (JSON array), features_unlocked (JSON array), created_at, updated_at
- [X] T002 Create database migration for onboarding_progress table

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core onboarding infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 (sample data standalone)
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 wizard completion but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent tutorials system
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent feature unlock system
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent dashboard (displays US3 checklist but works without it)
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent skip/re-enable mechanism

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before API endpoints
- API endpoints before frontend integration
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T003-T007)
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T011-T012)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Sample data generation tasks within US2 marked [P] can run in parallel (T031-T033)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 2 together:
Task: "E2E test for sample data generation in tests/e2e/test_onboarding_wizard.py::test_generate_sample_data"
Task: "E2E test for sample data cleanup in tests/e2e/test_onboarding_wizard.py::test_clear_sample_data"
Task: "Integration test for sample data flagging in tests/integration/test_onboarding.py::test_sample_data_flag"

# Launch all sample generation functions together:
Task: "Implement generate_sample_events() in api/services/sample_data_generator.py"
Task: "Implement generate_sample_teams() in api/services/sample_data_generator.py"
Task: "Implement generate_sample_volunteers() in api/services/sample_data_generator.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only - All P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T013) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Guided Setup Wizard (T014-T027)
4. **VALIDATE**: Test wizard independently, verify 4-step flow works
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Sample Data Exploration (T028-T043)
6. **VALIDATE**: Test sample data generation and cleanup independently
7. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 - Getting Started Checklist (T044-T059)
8. **VALIDATE**: Test checklist tracking and navigation independently
9. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all 3 P1 stories together (wizard ‚Üí sample data ‚Üí checklist integration)
10. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Scope**: User Stories 1-3 provide complete onboarding value:
- Guided setup wizard reduces time to first value
- Sample data enables hands-on learning
- Checklist provides clear progress tracking

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Basic wizard)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Learning environment)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Progress tracking - MVP!)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Interactive tutorials)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Progressive disclosure)
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full dashboard)
8. Add User Story 7 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Skip option)
9. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T013)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 - Guided Wizard (T014-T027)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 - Sample Data (T028-T043)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 - Checklist (T044-T059)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team continues with P2 stories in parallel:
   - Developer A: User Story 4 - Tutorials (T060-T074)
   - Developer B: User Story 5 - Feature Unlocks (T075-T090)
   - Developer C: User Story 6 - Dashboard (T091-T106)
5. Team completes P3 story together: User Story 7 - Skip Option (T107-T117)

- Provides complete guided onboarding experience
- Enables learning through sample data
- Tracks progress with checklist
- Delivers 80% of user value in 36% of total work

**Format Validation**: ‚úÖ ALL tasks follow checklist format (checkbox, ID, [P] marker where applicable, [Story] label for user story phases, file paths included)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
