- [ ] API-010 Success responses documented with schemas

## E2E Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

**Per Constitution Principle 1**: If a user can see it, click it, or type in it → it MUST have an E2E test

- [ ] E2E-001 E2E test written BEFORE implementation (failing test exists)
- [ ] E2E-002 Test simulates complete upgrade journey (login → billing portal → select plan → payment → verify upgrade)
- [ ] E2E-003 Test verifies what user SEES, not just API responses (plan name, pricing, limits)
- [ ] E2E-004 All billing portal UI elements tested (buttons, forms, navigation, payment input)
- [ ] E2E-005 Manual browser verification completed (no console errors, Stripe integration works)
- [ ] E2E-006 All E2E tests passing before merge to main
- [ ] E2E-007 Test covers trial workflow (start trial → use features → convert/cancel)
- [ ] E2E-008 Test covers failed payment workflow (card decline → retry → suspension)
- [ ] E2E-009 Test covers downgrade workflow (select lower plan → confirm → verify limits)
- [ ] E2E-010 Test covers cancellation workflow (cancel → confirm → verify data retention)

## Specification Quality

- [ ] SPEC-001 All 9 user stories have independent E2E tests
- [ ] SPEC-002 All 7 edge cases documented with handling strategy
- [ ] SPEC-003 All 45 functional requirements are testable
- [ ] SPEC-004 All 5 key entities have complete field lists
- [ ] SPEC-005 All 12 success criteria are measurable
- [ ] SPEC-006 All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers resolved (max 3 allowed)
- [ ] SPEC-007 No assumptions made without justification
- [ ] SPEC-008 Dependencies on external services documented (Stripe)
- [ ] SPEC-009 Migration path from current system specified
- [ ] SPEC-010 Rollback plan documented

## Clarifications Needed (Max 3)

- [ ] CLAR-001 Data retention period: 30 days, 60 days, or 90 days?
- [ ] CLAR-002 Refund policy for deletions: prorated refund or no refund?
- [ ] CLAR-003 Enterprise "unlimited" limits: truly unlimited or soft limit (e.g., 1000)?

## Notes

- **Critical Path**: This is a BLOCKER for SaaS launch - must be P1 priority
- **Dependencies**: Requires Stripe account setup, webhook configuration
- **Risk**: Payment processing errors can cause revenue loss - test thoroughly
- **Security**: PCI compliance critical - never store card data locally
- **E2E Testing**: Payment flows MUST be tested end-to-end with Stripe test mode
- **Constitution Compliance**: All 7 principles must be verified before implementation

**Validation Status**: ⏳ Awaiting clarification resolution before proceeding to planning phase
