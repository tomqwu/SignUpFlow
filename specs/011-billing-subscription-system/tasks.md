2. **Week 3**: Add trial support (US3) - Reduce conversion friction
3. **Week 4**: Add payment retry (US4) + tier changes (US5) - Reduce churn
4. **Week 5**: Add annual billing (US6) + cancellation (US7) - Improve cash flow
5. **Week 6**: Add portal (US8) + analytics (US9) - Reduce support load
6. **Week 7**: Webhooks (Phase 12) + Polish (Phase 13) - Production hardening

### Testing Approach

Tests are OPTIONAL per feature specification. If tests are added later:
1. Write integration tests FIRST for each user story before implementation
2. Write E2E test for complete subscription lifecycle
3. Test with Stripe test mode API keys and test cards (4242424242424242)
4. Verify webhook handling with Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/webhooks/stripe`
5. Target ‚â•99% test pass rate per project standards
