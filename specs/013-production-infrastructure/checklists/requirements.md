# Specification Quality Checklist: Production Infrastructure Deployment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec describes WHAT infrastructure capabilities are needed (zero-downtime, automated backups, HTTPS) without specifying HOW to implement (specific tools/frameworks left to planning phase).

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements include specific acceptance criteria. Success criteria use measurable metrics (99.9% uptime, 10-minute deployment, 30-second recovery). No clarifications needed - reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (8 prioritized user stories: P1/P2/P3)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (12 specific metrics)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. 8 user stories prioritized by criticality (4xP1, 3xP2, 1xP3). 31 functional requirements organized by capability area. 7 edge cases identified. All technology decisions deferred to planning phase.

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

**Summary**: Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan.

**Quality Score**: 100% (all checklist items passed)
