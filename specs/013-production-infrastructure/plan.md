# Implementation Plan: Production Infrastructure Deployment

**Branch**: `013-production-infrastructure` | **Date**: 2025-10-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/013-production-infrastructure/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Establish production-ready infrastructure enabling reliable, scalable SignUpFlow deployment with Docker containerization, PostgreSQL database migration, Traefik reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt HTTPS, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment, automated database backups with 30-day retention, health check endpoints, zero-downtime rolling deployments, and horizontal scaling capability. System targets 99.9% uptime with <10 minute deployment automation and <30 second failure recovery.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 (existing SignUpFlow backend), Docker 24+, PostgreSQL 15+
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Docker & Docker Compose 2.x (containerization)
- PostgreSQL 15+ (production database)
- Traefik 2.10+ (reverse proxy & Let's Encrypt)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipeline)
- Alembic 1.13+ (database migrations)
- psycopg2-binary 2.9+ (PostgreSQL adapter)

**Storage**: PostgreSQL 15+ (production database replacing SQLite), object storage for backups (S3/Azure Blob/GCS)
**Testing**: pytest 8.2+, pytest-playwright 0.7+ (E2E deployment tests), docker-compose for integration testing
**Target Platform**: Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended), Docker host, cloud provider or VPS
**Project Type**: Web application (existing architecture) + Infrastructure as Code

**Performance Goals**:
- Deployment automation: <10 minutes from merge to production
- Zero-downtime deployments: 100% request success rate during rolling updates
- Application startup: <30 seconds from container start to healthy
- Backup completion: <30 minutes for database backup
- Restore completion: <30 minutes for database restore
- Failure recovery: <30 seconds automatic restart

**Constraints**:
- Container image size: <500MB for fast deployment
- Database migration time: <5 minutes for schema changes
- Certificate provisioning: <5 minutes for HTTPS certificates
- Cost constraint: <$200/month infrastructure costs initially
- Backward compatibility: Must support upgrading from SQLite with zero data loss
- Security: HTTPS mandatory (PCI compliance for payments, SOC 2 requirements)

**Scale/Scope**:
- Expected load: <1000 concurrent users initially
- Database size: <10GB initially
- Deployment frequency: 1-5 deployments per week
- Backup retention: 30 days (automatic rotation)
- Log retention: 30 days minimum
- Infrastructure files: ~15 new files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, GitHub Actions workflows, Traefik config, backup scripts)
- Documentation: 5 deployment/operational guides

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Compliance Status**: ✅ PASS - All principles satisfied with infrastructure-specific interpretations

### Principle 1: User-First Testing (E2E MANDATORY)

✅ **COMPLIANT** - Infrastructure testing adapted for deployment workflows

**Infrastructure Testing Approach**:
- **US1 (Reliable Deployment)**: E2E test deploys to staging → verifies HTTP traffic → simulates container crash → verifies auto-restart → verifies health check
- **US2 (Database Migration)**: E2E test runs migration script → verifies data integrity → tests application connectivity → simulates rollback
- **US3 (CI/CD Pipeline)**: E2E test pushes code → verifies automated test execution → verifies container build → verifies staging deployment
- **US4 (HTTPS Configuration)**: E2E test configures domain → verifies certificate provisioning → verifies HTTP→HTTPS redirect
- **User Experience**: DevOps engineers experience automated deployments, zero-downtime updates, automatic recovery
- **Test Coverage**: 8 user stories × 3-5 scenarios each = ~30 E2E infrastructure tests

**Rationale**: Infrastructure "users" are DevOps engineers. Their "UI" is CLI commands, CI/CD dashboards, health check endpoints, and log outputs. E2E tests verify complete deployment workflows, not just individual components.

### Principle 2: Security-First Development

✅ **COMPLIANT** - Infrastructure security requirements explicitly defined

Security Requirements:
- **FR-014 to FR-017**: HTTPS mandatory with automatic Let's Encrypt certificates
- **FR-028 to FR-031**: Configuration via environment variables, secrets management, no hardcoded values
- **SEC-001 to SEC-007**: Encrypted secrets, HTTPS mandatory, backup encryption, vulnerability scanning, restricted database access, secrets rotation support

Infrastructure Security:
- Database credentials stored as environment variables, never in version control
- HTTPS enforced via Traefik automatic redirect
- Container images scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment
- PostgreSQL access restricted to application containers only (no public access)
- Backup files encrypted at rest in object storage

### Principle 3: Multi-tenant Isolation

✅ **COMPLIANT** - Infrastructure maintains application-level isolation

**Application maintains multi-tenant isolation**:
- Database migration scripts preserve existing `org_id` filtering
- PostgreSQL setup maintains same multi-tenant data model as SQLite
- No infrastructure changes affect application's org_id filtering logic
- Rolling deployments maintain isolation during updates

**Infrastructure does not break isolation**:
- Database backups include all organizations (no selective backup)
- Health checks test multi-tenant functionality
- Log aggregation preserves org_id context

### Principle 4: Test Coverage Excellence

✅ **COMPLIANT** - Comprehensive infrastructure testing strategy

**Test Types**:
- **Unit tests**: Deployment script functions, configuration validation, backup/restore logic
- **Integration tests**: Docker container startup, PostgreSQL connectivity, Traefik routing, health check endpoints
- **E2E tests**: Complete deployment workflows (8 user stories covering deploy, migrate, automate, scale)
- **Success Criteria**: SC-001 to SC-012 define measurable infrastructure outcomes (99.9% uptime, zero failed deployments, automatic recovery)

**Target**: Maintain ≥99% test pass rate (current project standard)

### Principle 5: Internationalization by Default

✅ **COMPLIANT** - Infrastructure preserves application i18n

**Application i18n maintained**:
- Container images include all 6 language locales (en, es, pt, zh-CN, zh-TW, fr)
- Environment variables support i18n configuration
- Database migration preserves translation keys and locale data
- No infrastructure changes affect application i18n functionality

**Infrastructure documentation**:
- Deployment guides written in English (technical DevOps audience)
- Error messages in English (standard for infrastructure tooling)

### Principle 6: Code Quality Standards

✅ **COMPLIANT** - Infrastructure follows best practices

**Quality Standards**:
- Dockerfile: Multi-stage builds, layer caching, security scanning
- docker-compose.yml: Environment-specific configurations, health checks, restart policies
- GitHub Actions: Reusable workflows, matrix testing, deployment gates
- Traefik config: YAML-based, version controlled, environment-specific
- Backup scripts: Idempotent, tested, with rollback capability
- No hardcoded values: All configuration via environment variables

**Documentation Quality**:
- Deployment guides with step-by-step instructions
- Troubleshooting runbooks for common issues
- Rollback procedures clearly documented
- Disaster recovery procedures tested and documented

### Principle 7: Clear Documentation

✅ **COMPLIANT** - Comprehensive infrastructure documentation

**Required Documentation** (from spec):
1. **Production Deployment Guide** - Complete deployment from scratch
2. **Environment Configuration Guide** - All environment variables documented
3. **Database Migration Guide** - SQLite → PostgreSQL migration process
4. **Rollback Procedures** - Failed deployment recovery
5. **Disaster Recovery Runbook** - Infrastructure restoration from backups
6. **Health Check Monitoring Guide** - Understanding health status
7. **Log Analysis Guide** - Common patterns and troubleshooting
8. **Backup and Restore Procedures** - Manual backup/restore when needed
9. **Scaling Guide** - When and how to scale infrastructure
10. **Certificate Management Guide** - Manual renewal if automation fails

**CLAUDE.md Update**: Add infrastructure architecture section describing deployment pipeline, containerization strategy, database setup, backup procedures

**Constitution Violations**: NONE

**Complexity Justification**: N/A (no violations to justify)
