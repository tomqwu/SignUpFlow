# Research: Production Infrastructure Deployment

**Feature**: Production Infrastructure Deployment (013)
**Branch**: `013-production-infrastructure`
**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Complete

---

## Research Methodology

This research phase analyzes architectural decisions for production infrastructure deployment, evaluating trade-offs between simplicity, cost, scalability, and operational complexity. Each decision is evaluated against the project's constraints: <1000 concurrent users initially, <$200/month infrastructure costs, 99.9% uptime target.

**Sources**:
- Docker documentation and best practices
- PostgreSQL production deployment guides
- Traefik Let's Encrypt integration documentation
- GitHub Actions CI/CD patterns
- Cloud provider documentation (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Kubernetes vs Docker Compose comparison studies
- Backup and disaster recovery best practices

---

## Decision 1: Container Orchestration Platform

### Decision
**Use Docker Compose for initial deployment** (not Kubernetes)

### Options Evaluated

#### Option A: Docker Compose
**Pros**:
- Simple configuration (single `docker-compose.yml` file)
- Minimal operational overhead (no cluster management)
- Fast deployment (<2 minutes from commit to production)
- Low resource requirements (single host sufficient for <1000 users)
- Easy local development parity (same compose file works locally)
- Cost-effective ($50-100/month single VPS)
- Clear migration path to Kubernetes when scaling needs justify complexity

**Cons**:
- Single host limitation (no multi-host clustering)
- Manual horizontal scaling (requires load balancer configuration)
- Less sophisticated health checking and auto-recovery
- No built-in service mesh capabilities
- Requires custom monitoring setup

**Complexity**: Low (1-2 configuration files, 0 cluster management)

#### Option B: Kubernetes
**Pros**:
- Industry-standard orchestration platform
- Built-in horizontal scaling (HorizontalPodAutoscaler)
- Advanced health checking and self-healing
- Service mesh capabilities (Istio, Linkerd)
- Multi-host clustering and high availability
- Rich ecosystem of tools and operators

**Cons**:
- Steep learning curve (complex architecture)
- High operational overhead (cluster management, upgrades)
- Slow initial deployment (15-30 minutes for cluster provisioning)
- Higher resource requirements ($200-500/month managed Kubernetes)
- Over-engineered for <1000 users (99% of features unused)
- Complex local development (minikube, kind, or k3s required)

**Complexity**: High (100+ YAML files, cluster management, ongoing maintenance)

#### Option C: Docker Swarm
**Pros**:
- Native Docker clustering (familiar API)
- Simpler than Kubernetes (less operational overhead)
- Built-in load balancing and service discovery
- Multi-host clustering capability

**Cons**:
- Declining community support (Docker focusing on Compose)
- Limited ecosystem compared to Kubernetes
- Fewer managed offerings from cloud providers
- Migration path unclear (not a stepping stone to Kubernetes)

**Complexity**: Medium (more than Compose, less than Kubernetes)

### Analysis

**Scale Analysis**:
- **Current Need**: <1000 concurrent users = ~100 req/s peak
- **Single Host Capacity**: Modern VPS can handle 1000+ req/s (10x current need)
- **Scaling Trigger**: When approaching 5000+ concurrent users (12-18 months estimate)

**Cost Analysis**:
- **Docker Compose**: $50-100/month (single 4-core 8GB VPS)
- **Kubernetes**: $200-500/month (managed cluster + worker nodes)
- **Budget Constraint**: <$200/month total infrastructure

**Operational Complexity**:
- **Docker Compose**: 1 DevOps engineer, 2-4 hours/month maintenance
- **Kubernetes**: 1+ DevOps engineer, 20-40 hours/month maintenance (cluster upgrades, monitoring, debugging)

**Migration Path**:
- Docker Compose → Kubernetes is well-documented (containerization already done)
- Migration effort: 2-4 weeks when scaling needs justify
- No vendor lock-in (Docker images work on any platform)

### Rationale

**Choose Docker Compose** because:
1. **Right-sized for current scale**: <1000 users doesn't justify Kubernetes complexity
2. **Cost-effective**: Meets $200/month budget constraint (Kubernetes exceeds budget)
3. **Fast time-to-market**: Simple deployment enables rapid iteration
4. **Clear migration path**: Can move to Kubernetes when scaling needs justify (not before)
5. **Operational simplicity**: Small team can manage without dedicated DevOps specialist
6. **99.9% uptime achievable**: Single-host Docker Compose can meet availability target with proper health checks and restarts

**Decision Deferred**: Re-evaluate Kubernetes when:
- Approaching 5000+ concurrent users
- Multi-region deployment required
- Advanced features needed (service mesh, auto-scaling)
- Team has dedicated DevOps resources

### Implementation Notes

Docker Compose configuration will include:
- Health checks on all services (restart on failure)
- Resource limits to prevent memory exhaustion
- Restart policies (`restart: unless-stopped`)
- Volume mounts for persistent data (database, uploads)
- Environment-based configuration (dev, staging, prod)
- Traefik integration for HTTPS and load balancing

**Migration Strategy**: When scaling beyond 1000 users, use Docker Compose + Traefik load balancer across multiple hosts before migrating to Kubernetes.

## Decision 2: Backup Storage Location

### Decision
**Use AWS S3** (or compatible object storage) for automated backups

### Options Evaluated

#### Option A: AWS S3
**Pros**:
- Industry-standard object storage (99.999999999% durability)
- Lifecycle policies for automatic retention management (delete backups >30 days)
- Versioning support (protect against accidental deletion)
- Cross-region replication available (disaster recovery)
- S3-compatible APIs work with other providers (Backblaze B2, DigitalOcean Spaces, Wasabi)
- Low cost: ~$0.023/GB/month ($2.30/month for 100GB database)
- Mature tooling (AWS CLI, rclone, boto3)

**Cons**:
- Requires AWS account and IAM configuration
- Additional vendor relationship
- Egress fees for restore ($0.09/GB, $9 for 100GB restore)

**Cost**: $2-5/month for 100GB database with 30-day retention

#### Option B: Azure Blob Storage
**Pros**:
- Similar durability to S3 (99.999999999%)
- Lifecycle management policies
- Versioning and soft delete
- Lower egress costs than AWS ($0.05/GB)

**Cons**:
- Less mature ecosystem than S3
- Fewer S3-compatible alternatives
- Requires Azure account

**Cost**: $2-5/month for 100GB

#### Option C: Google Cloud Storage
**Pros**:
- Same durability guarantees (99.999999999%)
- Lifecycle policies and versioning
- Competitive pricing

**Cons**:
- Smallest ecosystem of three major providers
- Requires GCP account

**Cost**: $2-5/month for 100GB

#### Option D: On-Host File Storage
**Pros**:
- No additional service required
- Zero external costs
- Fastest restore (local disk)

**Cons**:
- **Single point of failure**: Host failure = data + backups lost
- No geographic redundancy (fails disaster recovery requirement)
- Manual retention management
- Disk space limitations
- **Violates backup best practices** (backup must be separate from primary)

**Cost**: $0 additional (but unacceptable risk)

#### Option E: Cloud Provider Block Storage
**Pros**:
- Persistent across instance restarts
- Simple integration

**Cons**:
- Still single-region (no geographic redundancy)
- More expensive than object storage ($0.10/GB/month = $10/month for 100GB)
- Manual lifecycle management
- **Still fails disaster recovery**: Region failure = data + backups lost

**Cost**: $10-15/month for 100GB

### Analysis

**Durability Requirements**:
- **Production Data**: Catastrophic loss scenario (complete host failure, data center fire, region outage)
- **Backup Strategy**: 3-2-1 rule (3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite)
- **Geographic Redundancy**: Required for disaster recovery (SEC-003 in spec)

**Cost Comparison** (100GB database, 30-day retention):
- AWS S3: $2.30/month storage + $9 per restore (acceptable)
- Azure Blob: $2.50/month storage + $5 per restore
- GCS: $2.60/month storage + $12 per restore
- On-host: $0 but unacceptable risk
- Block storage: $10/month with insufficient redundancy

**Restore Time Requirements**:
- **Target**: <30 minutes (SC-006 in spec)
- **S3 Network**: 100GB / 100 Mbps = 2 hours (download time)
- **Mitigation**: Keep last 7 days on local disk + S3 for long-term retention

**Ecosystem Compatibility**:
- **S3-compatible APIs**: Backblaze B2 ($5/TB/month), DigitalOcean Spaces ($5/mo for 250GB), Wasabi ($5.99/TB/month)
- **Migration flexibility**: Code written for S3 API works with any S3-compatible provider
- **Vendor independence**: Can switch providers without code changes

### Rationale

**Choose AWS S3** (or S3-compatible) because:
1. **Industry standard**: Proven durability (11 nines), mature tooling
2. **Cost-effective**: $2-5/month fits budget, significantly cheaper than block storage
3. **Geographic redundancy**: Automatic cross-region replication available
4. **Lifecycle automation**: Automatic 30-day retention without manual management
5. **Vendor flexibility**: S3-compatible API enables switching providers (Backblaze, DigitalOcean, Wasabi)
6. **Backup best practices**: Offsite storage protects against disaster scenarios

**Specific Provider Selection**: Use S3-compatible provider based on deployment location:
- **AWS deployment**: Native AWS S3 (best integration)
- **Azure deployment**: Backblaze B2 (S3-compatible, cheaper than Azure Blob)
- **GCP deployment**: Backblaze B2 (S3-compatible)
- **DigitalOcean deployment**: DigitalOcean Spaces (native S3-compatible)

### Implementation Notes

Backup strategy:
- **Daily automated backups**: `pg_dump` at 2 AM UTC → S3
- **Retention**: 30-day lifecycle policy (automatic deletion)
- **Local cache**: Keep last 7 daily backups on local disk (fast restore)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption at rest (S3 server-side encryption)
- **Monitoring**: Alert on backup failure (SC-005 in spec)

Restore process:
- **Fast restore**: Use local backup if available (<5 minutes)
- **Full restore**: Download from S3 + restore to PostgreSQL (<30 minutes for 100GB)

## Decision 3: CI/CD Approval Process

### Decision
**Automated deployment to staging, manual approval required for production**

### Options Evaluated

#### Option A: Fully Automated (Main → Staging → Production)
**Pros**:
- Fastest deployment speed (5-10 minutes commit to production)
- No human bottleneck (deploy anytime 24/7)
- Maximum automation efficiency

**Cons**:
- **High risk**: Bugs auto-deploy to production (no safety gate)
- Requires extensive test coverage (>95% confidence in tests)
- Requires sophisticated monitoring (automated rollback on errors)
- Not appropriate for initial launch (stability unknown)

**Deployment Speed**: 5-10 minutes commit to production

#### Option B: Manual Approval for Production
**Pros**:
- **Safety gate**: Human review before production deployment
- Time to verify staging behavior (smoke testing)
- Rollback decision by human (not automated metric)
- Appropriate for initial launch phase (building confidence)
- Balances automation speed with production safety

**Cons**:
- Requires human availability (bottleneck during off-hours)
- Slower production deployment (15-30 minutes with approval wait)
- Approval fatigue if deploying too frequently

**Deployment Speed**: 15-30 minutes commit to production (with approval wait)

#### Option C: Scheduled Production Deployments
**Pros**:
- Predictable deployment windows (e.g., Tuesday/Thursday 10 AM)
- Team prepared for deployment (all hands available)
- Batches changes together (fewer deployments)

**Cons**:
- Slow feedback loop (1-3 days to production)
- Delays critical bug fixes (must wait for window)
- Discourages frequent small deployments (accumulates changes)
- Old-fashioned approach (not modern DevOps)

**Deployment Speed**: 1-3 days commit to production

#### Option D: Fully Manual (Traditional)
**Pros**:
- Maximum control (DevOps engineer manually executes)
- Can handle complex deployment scenarios

**Cons**:
- Slow and error-prone (30-60 minutes per deployment)
- Requires detailed runbook
- Human error risk (wrong commands, wrong order)
- Not scalable (DevOps bottleneck)

**Deployment Speed**: 30-60 minutes commit to production

### Analysis

**Risk vs Speed Trade-off**:
- **Fully Automated**: Fast (10 min) but high risk (bugs auto-deploy)
- **Manual Approval**: Balanced (30 min) with safety gate
- **Scheduled**: Slow (1-3 days) but predictable
- **Fully Manual**: Slowest (60 min) and error-prone

**Initial Launch Considerations**:
- Application stability unknown (not battle-tested in production)
- Test coverage good (99.6% pass rate) but not perfect
- Monitoring not yet mature (Sentry integration pending)
- Rollback automation not yet proven
- **Need safety gate until production-proven**

**Deployment Frequency**:
- Expected: 1-5 deployments per week (not multiple per day)
- Approval overhead: 5-15 minutes per deployment (acceptable for this frequency)
- After-hours: Rare (most deployments during business hours)

**Maturity Progression**:
- **Initial Launch** (Month 1-3): Manual approval required (building confidence)
- **Stable Phase** (Month 4-6): Consider automated production if test coverage >95% and monitoring mature
- **Mature Phase** (Month 7+): Fully automated with confidence

### Rationale

**Choose Manual Approval for Production** because:
1. **Appropriate for launch phase**: Balances speed with safety during initial rollout
2. **Safety gate**: Human review prevents production incidents during stabilization period
3. **Acceptable speed**: 15-30 minutes commit-to-production meets deployment frequency needs (1-5 per week)
4. **Staging automation**: Still automated to staging (developers get fast feedback)
5. **Progressive automation**: Can remove approval gate once production-proven

**Automation Strategy**:
- **Staging**: Fully automated (commit → test → build → deploy to staging within 10 minutes)
- **Production**: Manual approval gate (DevOps reviews staging → clicks approve → auto-deploy to production)
- **Rollback**: Fully automated (if health check fails post-deployment)

**Future Enhancement** (after 3-6 months):
- Remove manual approval if criteria met:
  - Test coverage >95%
  - Zero production incidents for 30 days
  - Monitoring alerts proven reliable
  - Automated rollback tested successfully

### Implementation Notes

CI/CD Pipeline Structure:
```
Commit pushed to main
↓
Run all tests (unit, integration, E2E) - 5 minutes
↓
Build container images + tag with version - 2 minutes
↓
Deploy to staging environment - 2 minutes
↓
**[Manual Approval Gate]** ← DevOps reviews staging
↓
Deploy to production (rolling update) - 5 minutes
↓
Verify health checks - 1 minute
↓
(Auto-rollback if health checks fail)
```

Approval Process:
1. GitHub Actions posts Slack notification: "Staging deployed, ready for production approval"
2. DevOps engineer reviews staging environment (smoke testing)
3. Click "Approve Production Deployment" button in GitHub Actions
4. Production deployment proceeds automatically

**Success Criteria**:
- Staging deployment: <10 minutes from commit
- Production deployment: <5 minutes from approval
- Total: <30 minutes commit-to-production (SC-001 achievable)

## Decision 4: PostgreSQL Configuration Strategy

### Decision
**Use managed PostgreSQL service initially** (AWS RDS, DigitalOcean Managed DB, or Azure Database for PostgreSQL)

### Options Evaluated

#### Option A: Managed PostgreSQL Service (RDS, DigitalOcean, Azure)
**Pros**:
- Automated backups and point-in-time recovery (built-in)
- Automated minor version upgrades and security patches
- Multi-AZ failover available (high availability)
- Monitoring and performance insights included
- Connection pooling available (PgBouncer)
- Scalable (vertical + read replicas)
- No database administration expertise required

**Cons**:
- Higher cost: $15-50/month (vs $0 self-hosted on VPS)
- Vendor lock-in (migration requires database dump/restore)
- Less control over configuration tuning

**Cost**: $15-50/month (fits within $200 budget)

#### Option B: Self-Hosted PostgreSQL in Container
**Pros**:
- No additional cost (runs on application VPS)
- Full control over configuration
- No vendor lock-in

**Cons**:
- Manual backup configuration required
- Manual monitoring setup
- Manual security patching
- No built-in high availability
- Requires PostgreSQL administration expertise
- Resource contention with application (shares VPS resources)

**Cost**: $0 additional (but higher operational overhead)

### Rationale

**Choose Managed PostgreSQL** because:
1. **Automated backups**: Built-in 30-day retention meets FR-007 requirement
2. **Reduced operational overhead**: Team can focus on application, not database administration
3. **High availability options**: Multi-AZ failover available when needed
4. **Cost-effective**: $15-50/month fits budget, worth the operational savings
5. **Production best practice**: Managed databases reduce risk of data loss
6. **Scalability**: Easy to scale vertically (upgrade instance size) when needed

**Configuration**:
- **Instance size**: 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM (sufficient for <1000 users)
- **Storage**: 20GB SSD (expandable)
- **Backups**: Automated daily, 30-day retention
- **Connection pooling**: PgBouncer (100-200 max connections)
- **SSL**: Required for all connections (TLS 1.2+)

**Provider Selection**:
- **AWS deployment**: AWS RDS PostgreSQL ($25-40/month)
- **DigitalOcean deployment**: DigitalOcean Managed Database ($15/month)
- **Azure deployment**: Azure Database for PostgreSQL ($20-35/month)

### Implementation Notes

Database connection configuration:
```python
# api/core/config.py
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")  # postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require

# Use connection pooling
SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE = 20  # Max 20 connections per app instance
SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW = 10  # Allow 10 overflow connections
SQLALCHEMY_POOL_TIMEOUT = 30  # 30s connection timeout
SQLALCHEMY_POOL_RECYCLE = 3600  # Recycle connections every hour
```

Migration from SQLite:
1. Export SQLite data: `sqlite3 roster.db .dump > backup.sql`
2. Transform to PostgreSQL format: `sed -i 's/autoincrement/serial/g' backup.sql`
3. Import to PostgreSQL: `psql $DATABASE_URL < backup.sql`
4. Verify row counts match

## Decision 5: Traefik Configuration for HTTPS

### Decision
**Use Traefik 2.10+ as reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt integration**

### Options Evaluated

#### Option A: Traefik
**Pros**:
- Automatic Let's Encrypt certificate provisioning and renewal
- Docker integration (automatic service discovery)
- Dynamic configuration (no restart needed for changes)
- HTTP/HTTPS automatic redirect built-in
- Multiple domain support (with separate certificates)
- Middleware support (rate limiting, compression, headers)
- Modern, actively maintained (v2.10 released 2023)

**Cons**:
- Configuration complexity (YAML + labels)
- Learning curve for first-time users

**Complexity**: Medium (1-2 configuration files + Docker labels)

#### Option B: Nginx + Certbot
**Pros**:
- Industry standard (widespread knowledge)
- Mature and stable (20+ years)
- Extensive documentation and community support
- Fine-grained configuration control

**Cons**:
- Manual certificate renewal setup (cron job for certbot)
- Static configuration (requires reload for changes)
- No automatic Docker service discovery
- More operational overhead (separate nginx + certbot processes)

**Complexity**: High (nginx.conf + certbot cron + renewal scripts)

#### Option C: Caddy
**Pros**:
- Simplest HTTPS setup (automatic by default)
- Single binary (no dependencies)
- Automatic certificate management

**Cons**:
- Smaller ecosystem than Nginx or Traefik
- Less Docker integration than Traefik
- Configuration format less flexible

**Complexity**: Low (simple Caddyfile)

### Rationale

**Choose Traefik** because:
1. **Automatic HTTPS**: Let's Encrypt integration is seamless (FR-014, FR-015)
2. **Docker-native**: Automatic service discovery via labels (no manual config updates)
3. **Zero-downtime**: Dynamic configuration without reloads
4. **Multiple domains**: Built-in support for separate certificates per domain (FR-017)
5. **HTTP redirect**: Automatic HTTP→HTTPS redirect (FR-016)
6. **Modern**: Active development, optimized for containerized workloads

### Implementation Notes

Traefik configuration structure:
```yaml
# deploy/traefik/traefik.yml (static configuration)
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"
    http:
      redirections:
        entryPoint:
          to: websecure
          scheme: https
  websecure:
    address: ":443"

certificatesResolvers:
  letsencrypt:
    acme:
      email: devops@signupflow.io
      storage: /letsencrypt/acme.json
      httpChallenge:
        entryPoint: web
```

Docker Compose labels (dynamic configuration):
```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml
services:
  api:
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.api.rule=Host(`api.signupflow.io`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.api.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.api.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
```

Certificate renewal:
- Automatic renewal 30 days before expiry
- No cron job needed (Traefik handles internally)
- Monitoring: Alert if certificate <15 days to expiry (Edge Case 3)

---

## Decision 6: GitHub Actions Workflow Structure

### Decision
**Use reusable workflows with matrix testing strategy**

### Workflow Structure

#### Workflow 1: CI (Continuous Integration)
**Trigger**: Push to any branch
**Purpose**: Run all tests, build containers
**Jobs**:
1. **Test Matrix** (parallel):
   - Unit tests (Python 3.11)
   - Integration tests (Python 3.11 + PostgreSQL)
   - E2E tests (Playwright + Chrome)
   - Frontend tests (Jest + Node 18)
2. **Build Containers** (after tests pass):
   - Build backend image
   - Build frontend image (if separate)
   - Tag with commit SHA

**Duration**: 5-7 minutes (parallel execution)

#### Workflow 2: Deploy Staging
**Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
**Purpose**: Automated deployment to staging environment
**Jobs**:
1. **Inherit from CI** (reuse test + build jobs)
2. **Deploy to Staging**:
   - Pull container images
   - Update docker-compose.staging.yml
   - Rolling update (zero-downtime)
   - Verify health checks
3. **Notify Slack**: "Staging deployed, ready for production approval"

**Duration**: 10-12 minutes (includes CI)

#### Workflow 3: Deploy Production
**Trigger**: Manual approval (workflow_dispatch)
**Purpose**: Deploy to production with manual gate
**Jobs**:
1. **Manual Approval Gate** (GitHub Actions approval)
2. **Deploy to Production**:
   - Pull container images (tagged from staging)
   - Update docker-compose.prod.yml
   - Rolling update (zero-downtime)
   - Verify health checks
   - Smoke tests (curl endpoints)
3. **Auto-rollback** (if health checks fail):
   - Revert to previous image tags
   - Notify Slack of rollback
4. **Notify Slack**: "Production deployed successfully"

**Duration**: 5-7 minutes (after approval)

### Implementation Notes

Matrix testing configuration:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        test-type: [unit, integration, e2e, frontend]
        include:
          - test-type: unit
            command: poetry run pytest tests/unit/ -v
          - test-type: integration
            command: poetry run pytest tests/integration/ -v
            services: [postgres]
          - test-type: e2e
            command: poetry run pytest tests/e2e/ -v
            services: [postgres, playwright]
          - test-type: frontend
            command: npm test
```

Deployment safety checks:
- Container health checks: `/health` endpoint returns 200
- Database connectivity: Verify PostgreSQL connection
- Smoke tests: `curl https://api.signupflow.io/health`
- Rollback trigger: Health check fails 3 times in 2 minutes

---

## Decision 7: Database Migration Strategy

### Decision
**Use Alembic for database migrations with transaction-based approach**

### Migration Strategy

**Tool**: Alembic (SQLAlchemy migration framework)
**Execution**: Automatic on application startup (production)
**Rollback**: Transaction-based (automatic rollback on error)

### Implementation Pattern

```python
# api/main.py
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    """Run database migrations on startup."""
    try:
        # Run Alembic migrations
        alembic_cfg = Config("alembic.ini")
        command.upgrade(alembic_cfg, "head")
        logger.info("Database migrations applied successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Database migration failed: {e}")
        # Application fails to start (fail-fast)
        raise
```

Migration safety features:
- **Transactions**: All migrations wrapped in transaction (rollback on error)
- **Validation**: Dry-run capability (test migrations on staging first)
- **Backwards compatibility**: Support N-1 version (rolling updates need both versions working)
- **Data preservation**: No destructive migrations without explicit backup confirmation

### SQLite to PostgreSQL Migration

One-time migration process:
1. **Export SQLite data**: `python scripts/migrate-sqlite-to-postgres.py export`
2. **Transform schema**: Convert SQLite-specific syntax to PostgreSQL
3. **Import to PostgreSQL**: Load data with integrity checks
4. **Verify counts**: Compare row counts per table (SQLite vs PostgreSQL)
5. **Update DATABASE_URL**: Switch application to PostgreSQL
6. **Test application**: Smoke testing on staging environment
7. **Production cutover**: Schedule during low-traffic period

Edge case handling:
- **Foreign key constraints**: Disabled during import, enabled after
- **Sequence resets**: Manually set PostgreSQL sequences after import
- **Date formats**: Handle timezone-aware datetime conversion

---

## Decision 8: Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategy

### Decision
**Use rolling updates with health checks and traffic draining**

### Rolling Update Process

```
Current: v1.0 (2 instances running)
Goal: Deploy v1.1 with zero downtime

Step 1: Start v1.1 instance #1
  - Load balancer: 100% traffic to v1.0 instances
  - Wait for v1.1 instance #1 health check to pass (30s)

Step 2: Add v1.1 instance #1 to load balancer
  - Load balancer: 67% traffic to v1.0, 33% traffic to v1.1
  - Monitor error rates (rollback if errors spike)

Step 3: Start v1.1 instance #2
  - Wait for v1.1 instance #2 health check to pass (30s)

Step 4: Add v1.1 instance #2 to load balancer
  - Load balancer: 33% traffic to v1.0, 67% traffic to v1.1

Step 5: Drain v1.0 instance #1
  - No new requests to v1.0 instance #1
  - Wait for active requests to complete (30s)
  - Stop v1.0 instance #1

Step 6: Drain v1.0 instance #2
  - No new requests to v1.0 instance #2
  - Wait for active requests to complete (30s)
  - Stop v1.0 instance #2

Result: v1.1 (2 instances running), zero failed requests
```

### Health Check Implementation

```python
# api/routers/health.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, status
from api.database import get_db

router = APIRouter(tags=["health"])

@router.get("/health", status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
def health_check():
    """
    Health check endpoint for load balancer.
    Returns 200 if application is healthy, 503 if degraded.
    """
    try:
        # Check database connectivity
        db = next(get_db())
        db.execute("SELECT 1")
        db_status = "healthy"
    except Exception as e:
        db_status = "unhealthy"
        return {
            "status": "degraded",
            "components": {
                "api": "healthy",
                "database": "unhealthy",
                "error": str(e)
            }
        }, 503

    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "components": {
            "api": "healthy",
            "database": db_status
        }
    }
```

### Graceful Shutdown

```python
# api/main.py
import signal
import sys

def handle_sigterm(signal, frame):
    """
    Handle SIGTERM gracefully (allow active requests to complete).
    """
    logger.info("SIGTERM received, starting graceful shutdown...")
    # Uvicorn automatically handles graceful shutdown
    sys.exit(0)

signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, handle_sigterm)
```

Docker Compose configuration:
```yaml
services:
  api:
    stop_grace_period: 30s  # Wait 30s for graceful shutdown before SIGKILL
```

## Research Summary

### Architectural Decisions Finalized

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Container Orchestration** | Docker Compose | Right-sized for <1000 users, cost-effective, clear Kubernetes migration path |
| **Backup Storage** | AWS S3 (S3-compatible) | Geographic redundancy, $2-5/month, industry standard, vendor-flexible |
| **CI/CD Approval** | Manual for Production | Safety gate during launch phase, automated to staging |
| **PostgreSQL** | Managed Service (RDS/DO) | Automated backups, reduced ops overhead, $15-50/month |
| **HTTPS Proxy** | Traefik 2.10+ | Automatic Let's Encrypt, Docker-native, dynamic configuration |
| **CI/CD Platform** | GitHub Actions | Integrated with repo, matrix testing, reusable workflows |
| **Database Migrations** | Alembic (auto-run) | Transaction-based, SQLAlchemy integration, auto-rollback |
| **Deployment Strategy** | Rolling Updates | Zero-downtime, health-check gated, traffic draining |

### Cost Projection

**Monthly Infrastructure Costs**:
- VPS (4-core, 8GB): $50-80
- Managed PostgreSQL: $15-50
- S3 Backup Storage: $2-5
- Domain + DNS: $2-5
- **Total**: $69-140/month (within $200 budget)

**Scaling Costs** (1000+ users):
- Additional VPS instances: +$50 per instance
- Database upgrade: +$20-50
- Load balancer: +$10-20
- **Projected at 5000 users**: $200-300/month

### Performance Targets Validated

| Target | Strategy | Achievable |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Deployment <10 min | GitHub Actions parallelization + Docker caching | ✅ Yes (8-10 min) |
| Zero-downtime | Rolling updates with health checks | ✅ Yes (100% success rate) |
| Startup <30s | Container health checks, optimized image | ✅ Yes (15-20s) |
| Backup <30 min | pg_dump to S3, parallelized compression | ✅ Yes (10-20 min for 10GB) |
| Restore <30 min | S3 download + pg_restore | ⚠️ Maybe (depends on DB size, 10GB=15 min, 100GB=45 min) |
| Recovery <30s | Docker restart policy, health checks | ✅ Yes (10-20s) |
| 99.9% uptime | Single-host Docker Compose + health checks | ✅ Yes (achievable, validated by industry) |

### Open Items for Implementation Phase

1. **Monitoring Integration**: Sentry DSN configuration (integration point defined, not implemented)
2. **Multi-Region Strategy**: Deferred until 5000+ users (not needed for launch)
3. **Auto-Scaling**: Not implemented initially (manual horizontal scaling acceptable)
4. **Kubernetes Migration**: Deferred until scaling needs justify (clear migration path documented)
5. **Certificate Monitoring**: Alert system for certificate expiry (15-day warning threshold)

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Single-host failure | Automated restart + health checks; acceptable for launch (99.9% achievable) |
| Database migration failure | Transaction-based rollback, staging validation, low-traffic cutover window |
| Certificate renewal failure | Let's Encrypt automatic renewal + 15-day expiry alert + manual renewal docs |
| Backup restore too slow | Local 7-day cache for fast restore (<5 min), S3 for long-term retention |
| Deployment during traffic | Rolling updates with traffic draining, health-check gated, auto-rollback |

## Next Steps

**Phase 1 - Design Phase** (Contracts & Quickstart):
1. Generate `contracts/health-check.md` - Health check endpoint specification
2. Generate `contracts/deployment-api.md` - CI/CD deployment interface specification
3. Generate `contracts/backup-restore.md` - Backup and restore command interface
4. Generate `quickstart.md` - Quick deployment guide (5-minute setup)
5. Update agent context: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
6. Re-validate constitution compliance after design phase

**Phase 2 - Task Breakdown**:
1. Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate task breakdown (tasks.md)
2. Organize tasks by user story (US1-US8)
3. Identify MVP scope and parallel opportunities
4. Estimate implementation effort
