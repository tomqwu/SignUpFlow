# Feature Specification: Production Infrastructure Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `013-production-infrastructure`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Type**: Infrastructure (Launch Blocker)

---

## Overview

**Purpose**: Establish production-ready infrastructure that enables reliable, scalable, and maintainable deployment of SignUpFlow in production environments with zero-downtime updates, automated backups, and comprehensive monitoring.

**Business Value**: Enables SignUpFlow to serve paying customers reliably with professional-grade infrastructure meeting SaaS availability and security expectations.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Reliable Production Deployment (Priority: P1)

DevOps engineers deploy SignUpFlow to production environments with confidence that the system will run reliably, recover from failures automatically, and handle real-world load.

**Why this priority**: P1 - This is the foundation for SaaS launch. Without reliable production deployment, we cannot serve paying customers.

**Independent Test**: Deploy application to production environment, verify it serves traffic correctly, survives container restart, and recovers from database connection loss.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a production environment, **When** DevOps deploys the application, **Then** the system starts successfully and serves HTTP traffic
2. **Given** the application is running, **When** a container crashes, **Then** the system automatically restarts and resumes service within 30 seconds
3. **Given** database connection is lost, **When** connection is restored, **Then** application reconnects automatically without manual intervention
4. **Given** environment variables are configured, **When** application starts, **Then** it uses production configuration (not development defaults)

---

### User Story 2 - Database Production Migration (Priority: P1)

Operations team migrates from development SQLite database to production-grade PostgreSQL with all existing data preserved and application downtime minimized.

**Why this priority**: P1 - PostgreSQL is required for production scale (SQLite cannot handle concurrent writes from multiple users).

**Independent Test**: Run migration script on staging environment, verify all data migrates correctly, application connects to PostgreSQL, and no data is lost.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** existing SQLite database with production data, **When** migration runs, **Then** all data transfers to PostgreSQL without loss
2. **Given** application configured for PostgreSQL, **When** it starts, **Then** it connects successfully and serves requests
3. **Given** schema changes in new version, **When** migration runs, **Then** database schema updates automatically
4. **Given** migration fails mid-process, **When** rollback executes, **Then** system returns to previous working state

---

### User Story 3 - Automated Deployment Pipeline (Priority: P1)

Developers push code changes to main branch and CI/CD pipeline automatically tests, builds, and deploys to production without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Manual deployments are error-prone and slow. Automated pipeline is essential for rapid iteration and reliability.

**Independent Test**: Push code change to main branch, verify CI/CD runs tests, builds containers, and deploys to staging environment automatically.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code pushed to main branch, **When** CI/CD pipeline runs, **Then** all tests execute and must pass before deployment
2. **Given** tests pass, **When** pipeline builds containers, **Then** containers are tagged with version and pushed to registry
3. **Given** containers built, **When** pipeline deploys to staging, **Then** staging environment updates with new version
4. **Given** staging deployment succeeds, **When** manual approval given, **Then** production environment updates with new version
5. **Given** deployment fails, **When** rollback triggered, **Then** previous version restores automatically

---

### User Story 4 - HTTPS and Domain Configuration (Priority: P1)

Operations team configures custom domain with automatic HTTPS certificate provisioning and renewal, ensuring all traffic is encrypted.

**Why this priority**: P1 - HTTPS is mandatory for production (required for authentication, payment processing, user trust).

**Independent Test**: Point custom domain to application, verify HTTPS certificate provisions automatically, and all HTTP traffic redirects to HTTPS.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** custom domain configured, **When** user visits HTTP URL, **Then** they redirect automatically to HTTPS
2. **Given** HTTPS certificate needed, **When** system starts, **Then** certificate provisions automatically within 5 minutes
3. **Given** certificate expiring, **When** 30 days before expiry, **Then** certificate renews automatically
4. **Given** multiple domains configured, **When** certificates provision, **Then** each domain has valid certificate

---

### User Story 5 - Zero-Downtime Deployments (Priority: P2)

DevOps deploys new application versions without interrupting active user sessions or causing service unavailability.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Improves user experience by eliminating deployment windows, but not critical for initial launch (can schedule maintenance windows initially).

**Independent Test**: Deploy new version while simulating active user traffic, verify no requests fail during deployment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application serving traffic, **When** new version deploys, **Then** active requests complete successfully
2. **Given** deployment in progress, **When** new requests arrive, **Then** they route to healthy instances
3. **Given** new version deployed, **When** health check fails, **Then** deployment rolls back automatically
4. **Given** old version running, **When** new version starts, **Then** traffic gradually shifts to new version (rolling update)

---

### User Story 6 - Automated Database Backups (Priority: P2)

Operations team relies on automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery capability to protect against data loss.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Critical for data safety but not required for initial launch (can do manual backups initially).

**Independent Test**: Trigger backup, delete database, restore from backup, and verify all data restored correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application running, **When** daily backup time reached, **Then** backup completes automatically
2. **Given** backup exists, **When** restore requested, **Then** database restores to backup point in time
3. **Given** backup storage space full, **When** new backup runs, **Then** old backups delete automatically (retention policy)
4. **Given** backup fails, **When** failure detected, **Then** operations team receives alert

---

### User Story 7 - Application Health Monitoring (Priority: P2)

Operations team monitors application health in real-time with automatic alerts when issues occur, enabling proactive problem resolution.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Important for operational excellence but can start with manual monitoring initially.

**Independent Test**: Simulate application failure (e.g., database down), verify health check fails and alert triggers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application running, **When** health check endpoint called, **Then** it returns healthy status with component details
2. **Given** database unavailable, **When** health check runs, **Then** it reports degraded status
3. **Given** application unhealthy, **When** monitoring system checks, **Then** alert sends to operations team
4. **Given** application recovers, **When** health check succeeds, **Then** alert clears automatically

---

### User Story 8 - Horizontal Scaling Capability (Priority: P3)

Operations team scales application capacity by adding more instances to handle increased load without architectural changes.

**Why this priority**: P3 - Nice to have for future growth but not needed for initial launch (can scale vertically initially).

**Independent Test**: Add second application instance, verify load distributes across both instances.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** single instance running, **When** second instance added, **Then** traffic distributes across both instances
2. **Given** high load detected, **When** scaling threshold exceeded, **Then** additional instances start automatically (future: auto-scaling)
3. **Given** multiple instances running, **When** one instance fails, **Then** traffic routes to healthy instances
4. **Given** load decreases, **When** scaling down triggered, **Then** excess instances terminate gracefully

---

### Edge Cases

**Edge Case 1: Deployment During High Traffic**
- **Scenario**: New version deploys during peak usage period
- **Expected Behavior**: Deployment proceeds without impacting active users; rolling update ensures capacity maintained
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Rolling update strategy with health checks

**Edge Case 2: Database Migration Failure**
- **Scenario**: Migration script encounters error mid-process (e.g., constraint violation)
- **Expected Behavior**: Migration rolls back automatically, system returns to previous state, error details logged
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Transaction-based migration with rollback capability

**Edge Case 3: Certificate Renewal Failure**
- **Scenario**: HTTPS certificate fails to renew automatically (e.g., DNS issue)
- **Expected Behavior**: Alert triggers 15 days before expiry, manual renewal documentation provided, fallback to existing certificate
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Certificate monitoring with alerting

**Edge Case 4: Backup Restore to Different Environment**
- **Scenario**: Production backup restored to staging environment for testing
- **Expected Behavior**: Restore process sanitizes sensitive data, updates configuration for staging environment
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Environment-aware restore process

**Edge Case 5: Simultaneous Deployments**
- **Scenario**: Two developers trigger deployments simultaneously
- **Expected Behavior**: CI/CD pipeline serializes deployments, second waits for first to complete
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Deployment locking mechanism

**Edge Case 6: Complete Infrastructure Failure**
- **Scenario**: Entire production environment becomes unavailable (e.g., provider outage)
- **Expected Behavior**: Disaster recovery documentation guides restoration from backups in new environment
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Disaster recovery runbook

**Edge Case 7: Log Storage Exhaustion**
- **Scenario**: Application logs consume all available disk space
- **Expected Behavior**: Log rotation policy automatically deletes old logs, critical logs preserved
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Log rotation and retention policy
