# Specification Quality Checklist: Security Hardening and Compliance

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec describes WHAT security capabilities are needed (rate limiting, audit logging, CSRF protection, 2FA) without specifying HOW to implement. All technology decisions (Redis, specific auth libraries, storage mechanisms) documented in assumptions or deferred to planning phase. Language is accessible to business stakeholders describing security threats and protections in plain terms.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements include specific acceptance criteria (e.g., "5 failed attempts within 5 minutes triggers 15-minute lockout"). Success criteria use measurable metrics (100% attack blocking, <1 second audit logging, 95% 2FA enrollment success). No clarifications needed - reasonable security defaults documented in Assumptions section (90-day log retention, 1-hour token expiry, ±30 second TOTP tolerance).

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (8 prioritized user stories: 5xP1, 2xP2, 0xP3)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (12 specific security metrics)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. 8 user stories prioritized by security criticality (5xP1: rate limiting, audit logging, CSRF, session invalidation, input validation, password reset; 2xP2: 2FA, security headers). 44 functional requirements organized by security category. 7 edge cases covering attack vectors and failure scenarios. All technology decisions deferred to planning phase.

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

**Summary**: Specification is complete, comprehensive, and technology-agnostic. Ready for `/speckit.plan` to create technical security implementation plan.

**Quality Score**: 100% (all checklist items passed)
