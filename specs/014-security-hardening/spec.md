# Feature Specification: Security Hardening and Compliance

**Feature Branch**: `014-security-hardening`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Type**: Security (Launch Blocker)

---

## Overview

**Purpose**: Strengthen application security posture with comprehensive protection against common attacks, enforce security best practices, provide audit capabilities for compliance requirements, and implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced account protection.

**Business Value**: Protects user data and organizational information from security threats, ensures compliance with security standards, builds customer trust through robust security practices, and reduces risk of data breaches and associated costs.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Rate Limiting Protection (Priority: P1)

Malicious actors attempting brute force attacks on authentication endpoints are automatically blocked after exceeding rate limits, protecting all user accounts from unauthorized access attempts.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Critical for launch. Without rate limiting, the application is vulnerable to credential stuffing and brute force attacks that could compromise user accounts.

**Independent Test**: Simulate 10 failed login attempts from same IP address within 1 minute, verify account is temporarily locked and attacker receives rate limit error message.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user attempts to log in, **When** they fail authentication 5 times within 5 minutes, **Then** further login attempts are blocked for 15 minutes
2. **Given** rate limit is active, **When** legitimate user tries to log in during lockout period, **Then** they see clear message explaining wait time and security measure
3. **Given** rate limit expires, **When** user attempts login again, **Then** they can authenticate normally
4. **Given** admin accesses system management, **When** they exceed rate limit for sensitive operations, **Then** their session requires re-authentication

---

### User Story 2 - Audit Logging for Compliance (Priority: P1)

System automatically records all admin actions and security events in tamper-evident audit log, providing compliance officers and security teams with complete activity trail for investigation and regulatory requirements.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Essential for SaaS launch. Many organizations require audit trails for compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR). Without audit logging, we cannot serve enterprise customers.

**Independent Test**: Admin creates event, modifies user roles, deletes team - verify all actions logged with timestamp, actor ID, action type, affected resources, and outcome.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin modifies user permissions, **When** action completes, **Then** audit log records actor, timestamp, user ID, old permissions, new permissions, and success status
2. **Given** security event occurs (failed login, password reset), **When** event triggers, **Then** audit log captures event type, IP address, user agent, timestamp, and outcome
3. **Given** compliance officer requests audit report, **When** they export logs for date range, **Then** system provides complete tamper-evident log with all required fields
4. **Given** audit log entry created, **When** anyone attempts to modify or delete it, **Then** operation fails (logs are append-only and immutable)

---

### User Story 3 - CSRF Protection (Priority: P1)

Users performing state-changing actions (create, update, delete) are protected from cross-site request forgery attacks, preventing malicious websites from performing unauthorized actions on their behalf.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Critical security vulnerability. OWASP Top 10 risk. Without CSRF protection, attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions.

**Independent Test**: Attempt to submit form without valid CSRF token, verify request is rejected with 403 Forbidden. Submit same form with valid token, verify request succeeds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user loads form for state-changing operation, **When** form renders, **Then** unique CSRF token is embedded in form
2. **Given** user submits form with valid token, **When** server receives request, **Then** token is validated and request proceeds
3. **Given** attacker crafts malicious form without token, **When** victim submits form, **Then** server rejects request due to missing/invalid token
4. **Given** CSRF token expires after 1 hour, **When** user submits form with expired token, **Then** server rejects request and prompts user to refresh page

---

### User Story 4 - Session Invalidation on Security Events (Priority: P1)

When users change their password or administrators modify their account permissions, all active sessions are immediately invalidated, forcing re-authentication to prevent unauthorized access using old credentials or elevated permissions.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Security best practice. Prevents attackers from maintaining access after password changes or privilege revocations.

**Independent Test**: User logs in on two devices, changes password on first device, attempts to use application on second device - verify second device is logged out and requires re-authentication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has active sessions on multiple devices, **When** they change password, **Then** all sessions except current one are invalidated
2. **Given** admin downgrades user from admin to volunteer role, **When** role change completes, **Then** user's active sessions are invalidated and they must re-authenticate with new permissions
3. **Given** user is logged in, **When** admin locks their account for security reasons, **Then** all active sessions immediately terminate
4. **Given** session invalidation occurs, **When** user attempts to use invalidated session, **Then** they are redirected to login with explanation message

---

### User Story 5 - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (Priority: P2)

Users can enable two-factor authentication using authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.), requiring time-based one-time password (TOTP) in addition to password for login, significantly increasing account security.

**Why this priority**: P2 - High value security enhancement but not blocking for initial launch. Can be added shortly after launch to serve security-conscious customers.

**Independent Test**: User enables 2FA, logs out, attempts login with password only (fails), attempts login with password + correct TOTP code (succeeds).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user wants to enable 2FA, **When** they access security settings, **Then** system generates QR code and secret key for authenticator app setup
2. **Given** user scans QR code with authenticator app, **When** they enter verification code, **Then** 2FA is activated on their account
3. **Given** user has 2FA enabled, **When** they log in with username/password, **Then** system prompts for 6-digit TOTP code before granting access
4. **Given** user loses access to authenticator app, **When** they use backup recovery codes, **Then** they can regain account access and reconfigure 2FA
5. **Given** 2FA code is incorrect, **When** user attempts login 3 times with wrong code, **Then** account is temporarily locked for 15 minutes

---

### User Story 6 - Security Headers (Priority: P2)

Browser security features are activated through HTTP security headers, protecting users from clickjacking, XSS attacks, and insecure connections by instructing browsers to enforce security policies.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Important security hardening but not critical for launch. Provides defense-in-depth protection against client-side attacks.

**Independent Test**: Inspect HTTP response headers, verify presence of HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options with correct values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses application over HTTPS, **When** response is sent, **Then** Strict-Transport-Security header forces HTTPS for all future requests
2. **Given** attacker attempts to embed application in iframe, **When** browser processes response, **Then** X-Frame-Options header prevents iframe rendering
3. **Given** application loads resources, **When** Content-Security-Policy header is present, **Then** browser blocks inline scripts and restricts resource sources to approved domains
4. **Given** user accesses application, **When** response headers are set, **Then** X-Content-Type-Options prevents MIME type sniffing attacks

---

### User Story 7 - Input Validation and Sanitization (Priority: P1)

All user inputs are validated and sanitized before processing or storage, preventing injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection) and ensuring data integrity throughout the application.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Critical security requirement. OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (#1 Injection, #2 Broken Authentication, #3 XSS). Must be addressed before launch.

**Independent Test**: Submit form with malicious payloads (SQL injection attempts, XSS scripts, special characters), verify inputs are sanitized and attacks fail without compromising system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user submits form with SQL injection attempt in text field, **When** input is processed, **Then** malicious SQL is escaped/sanitized and database query executes safely
2. **Given** user enters JavaScript code in name field, **When** name is displayed in UI, **Then** script tags are escaped and rendered as harmless text
3. **Given** user uploads file, **When** file is processed, **Then** file type is validated against whitelist and malicious files are rejected
4. **Given** admin enters configuration value, **When** value contains special characters, **Then** characters are properly escaped before being stored or displayed

---

### User Story 8 - Secure Password Reset (Priority: P1)

Users who forget their password can securely reset it using time-limited, single-use reset tokens sent to their registered email, preventing unauthorized password changes and account takeover.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Essential user account security. Password reset is common attack vector. Must be implemented securely before launch.

**Independent Test**: Request password reset, receive email with unique token, use token to set new password successfully, attempt to reuse same token (fails).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user requests password reset, **When** they submit their email, **Then** system sends reset link with unique token valid for 1 hour
2. **Given** user receives reset email, **When** they click link within 1 hour, **Then** they can set new password
3. **Given** reset token expires after 1 hour, **When** user tries to use expired token, **Then** system rejects reset and offers to send new token
4. **Given** password is successfully reset, **When** reset token is used, **Then** token is permanently invalidated and cannot be reused
5. **Given** user requests multiple password resets, **When** new request is made, **Then** all previous tokens for that user are invalidated

---

### Edge Cases

**Edge Case 1: Rate Limit False Positives**
- **Scenario**: Legitimate user behind shared IP (office, café) encounters rate limit due to other users' failed logins
- **Expected Behavior**: User can verify identity through alternative method (security questions, email verification link) to bypass rate limit temporarily
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Intelligent rate limiting tracks per-user and per-IP separately, allows bypass for verified users

**Edge Case 2: 2FA Device Loss**
- **Scenario**: User loses phone with authenticator app and cannot generate TOTP codes
- **Expected Behavior**: User can use backup recovery codes (provided during 2FA setup) to regain access and reconfigure 2FA
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] System generates 10 single-use backup codes during 2FA enrollment, stored encrypted

**Edge Case 3: Session Invalidation During Active Work**
- **Scenario**: User is editing complex form when admin changes their permissions, invalidating session mid-edit
- **Expected Behavior**: System saves draft work before session invalidation, allows user to recover draft after re-authentication
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Periodic draft auto-save with session-independent storage, recovery after re-login

**Edge Case 4: Audit Log Storage Exhaustion**
- **Scenario**: Audit logs grow to consume excessive storage (years of detailed logs)
- **Expected Behavior**: System implements log retention policy (90 days detailed, 1 year aggregated, purge after 1 year unless flagged for compliance)
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Automated log rotation and archival with configurable retention policies

**Edge Case 5: CSRF Token Mismatch in Multi-Tab Editing**
- **Scenario**: User opens same form in multiple browser tabs, submits one tab (invalidates token), then submits second tab
- **Expected Behavior**: Second tab detects stale token, refreshes token automatically before submission
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Client-side token refresh mechanism with silent background token renewal

**Edge Case 6: Password Reset Token Interception**
- **Scenario**: Attacker intercepts password reset email and uses token before legitimate user
- **Expected Behavior**: Legitimate user receives notification of password change, can initiate account recovery process
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Send confirmation email after password reset with "I didn't do this" recovery link

**Edge Case 7: Brute Force via Distributed Attack**
- **Scenario**: Attacker uses distributed botnet across many IP addresses to bypass IP-based rate limiting
- **Expected Behavior**: Account-level rate limiting triggers after total failed attempts across all IPs exceed threshold
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Multi-layer rate limiting: per-IP, per-account, global anomaly detection

## Technical Constraints

1. **JWT Token Compatibility**: Security enhancements must not break existing JWT-based authentication system
2. **Session Storage**: Current localStorage-based sessions may need enhancement for invalidation tracking
3. **Database Performance**: Audit logging must not degrade application performance (target: <10ms overhead per logged action)
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Security headers must work across all supported browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
5. **TOTP Standards**: 2FA implementation must follow RFC 6238 (TOTP) for compatibility with standard authenticator apps
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing users without 2FA must continue to work while new users can opt into 2FA

---

## Assumptions

1. **Email Delivery**: Assume reliable email delivery for password reset and 2FA enrollment (acceptable 1-5 minute delivery time)
2. **User Time Zones**: TOTP validation assumes user devices have reasonably accurate time (±5 minutes acceptable)
3. **Audit Log Volume**: Assume average 1000 admin actions per day per organization (manageable with 90-day retention)
4. **2FA Adoption**: Assume 20-30% of users will enable 2FA initially, growing to 50% over 6 months
5. **Rate Limit Impact**: Assume <1% of legitimate users will encounter rate limits (acceptable false positive rate)
6. **Security Header Support**: Assume all target browsers support modern security headers (no legacy IE support needed)
7. **Token Entropy**: Assume crypto.getRandomValues() or equivalent provides sufficient entropy for secure token generation
8. **Session Concurrency**: Assume average user has 2-3 active sessions (phone, desktop, tablet)

---

## Security Considerations

- **SEC-001**: All password reset tokens must be cryptographically secure random values (minimum 128-bit entropy)
- **SEC-002**: 2FA secret keys and backup codes must be encrypted at rest using organization-level encryption keys
- **SEC-003**: Audit logs must be stored in tamper-evident manner (append-only database, cryptographic checksums)
- **SEC-004**: CSRF tokens must be unpredictable and tied to specific user sessions (no global tokens)
- **SEC-005**: Rate limiting must be implemented server-side (client-side rate limiting is insufficient)
- **SEC-006**: Input sanitization must occur on server side (client-side validation is defense-in-depth only)
- **SEC-007**: Session invalidation must be atomic (all related sessions terminated simultaneously to prevent race conditions)
- **SEC-008**: 2FA backup codes must be single-use and invalidated immediately after use
- **SEC-009**: Security headers must be set by server, not modifiable by client
- **SEC-010**: All security-related configuration values must be environment variables, never hardcoded

## Open Questions & Decisions

### Decision 1: Rate Limit Storage
**Decision**: Use in-memory cache (Redis) for rate limit counters with database backup for persistent lockouts
**Rationale**: In-memory provides fast rate limit checks (<1ms), database ensures lockouts persist across server restarts
**Date**: TBD (implementation phase)

### Decision 2: Audit Log Storage
**Decision**: Separate audit log database or dedicated table with append-only constraints
**Rationale**: Isolation prevents accidental deletion/modification, dedicated table allows independent backup/archival
**Date**: TBD (implementation phase)

### Decision 3: 2FA Enforcement
**Decision**: 2FA is optional for all users initially, with admin setting to require 2FA for specific roles
**Rationale**: Balance security with user experience, allow gradual adoption, enable enforcement for high-privilege accounts
**Date**: TBD (implementation phase)

### Decision 4: CSRF Token Implementation
**Decision**: Use double-submit cookie pattern or synchronized token pattern (session-based)
**Rationale**: Both provide equivalent security, choice depends on existing session architecture
**Date**: TBD (implementation phase)
