# Specification Quality Checklist: Monitoring and Observability Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec describes WHAT monitoring capabilities are needed (error tracking, health checks, performance metrics, alerting) without specifying HOW to implement. All technology decisions (Sentry vs Rollbar, Prometheus vs InfluxDB, CloudWatch vs Datadog) documented in assumptions or deferred to planning phase. Language is accessible to operations stakeholders describing operational visibility needs in plain terms.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements include specific acceptance criteria (e.g., "error appears within 30 seconds", "health check responds within 3 seconds", "log search completes within 2 seconds"). Success criteria use measurable metrics (30 seconds detection, 5 minutes MTTD, <1% CPU overhead, 95% search speed, <5% false positive rate). No clarifications needed - reasonable monitoring defaults documented in Assumptions section (7-day log retention, 30-second health check interval, $100/month budget, Sentry for error tracking).

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (8 prioritized user stories: 3xP1, 3xP2, 2xP3)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (12 specific operational metrics)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. 8 user stories prioritized by operational criticality (3xP1: error tracking, health checks, metrics dashboard - essential for production operations; 3xP2: alert configuration, log search, status page - important for operations efficiency; 2xP3: bottleneck identification, retention policies - nice-to-have automation). 46 functional requirements organized by monitoring category (Error Tracking, Health Checks, Performance Metrics, Alerting, Log Management, Status Page, Performance Analysis, Retention & Storage, Security & Access, Performance & Reliability). 7 edge cases covering operational scenarios (monitoring system failure, alert storms, high cardinality metrics, clock skew, cost spikes, false positives, sensitive data in logs). All technology decisions deferred to planning phase.

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

**Summary**: Specification is complete, comprehensive, and technology-agnostic. Ready for `/speckit.plan` to create technical monitoring implementation plan.

**Quality Score**: 100% (all checklist items passed)
