# Feature Specification: Monitoring and Observability Platform

**Feature Branch**: `015-monitoring-observability`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Type**: Infrastructure (Launch Blocker)

---

## Overview

**Purpose**: Establish comprehensive production monitoring and observability that enables operations teams to proactively identify, diagnose, and resolve issues before they impact users, ensuring system reliability and performance visibility.

**Business Value**: Reduces mean time to detection (MTTD) and mean time to resolution (MTTR) for production issues, prevents revenue loss from outages, and enables data-driven infrastructure optimization decisions.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Real-Time Error Tracking and Alerting (Priority: P1)

Operations team receives immediate notification when critical errors occur in production, with full context (stack traces, user impact, environment details) enabling rapid debugging and resolution before widespread user impact.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Critical for production operations. Without real-time error tracking, the team operates blind, discovering issues only after user complaints or revenue loss. This is the foundation of production monitoring.

**Independent Test**: Trigger a simulated application error (e.g., database connection failure), verify error appears in monitoring dashboard within 30 seconds with full stack trace, and verify Slack alert received immediately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application encounters unhandled exception, **When** error occurs, **Then** error tracking system captures full stack trace, user context, and environment details within 5 seconds
2. **Given** error threshold exceeded (>10 errors/minute), **When** monitoring system detects threshold breach, **Then** immediate Slack notification sent to operations channel with error summary and dashboard link
3. **Given** identical error occurs multiple times, **When** errors are grouped, **Then** system deduplicates and shows single error with occurrence count (prevents alert fatigue)
4. **Given** critical error resolved, **When** operations marks error as resolved in dashboard, **Then** future occurrences of same error trigger new alert (not suppressed)

---

### User Story 2 - Health Check Endpoints (Priority: P1)

Operations team and load balancers continuously monitor application health through standardized health check endpoints, enabling automatic traffic routing away from unhealthy instances and immediate awareness of component failures.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Required for production deployment with load balancing and zero-downtime updates. Without health checks, load balancers cannot detect unhealthy instances, routing traffic to failed services.

**Independent Test**: Stop database service, verify `/health` endpoint returns 503 with component status details, and verify load balancer automatically removes instance from rotation within health check interval.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** all system components operational, **When** `/health` endpoint called, **Then** returns 200 OK with JSON showing all components status "healthy"
2. **Given** database connection lost, **When** `/health` endpoint called, **Then** returns 503 Service Unavailable with component status showing database "unhealthy" and specific error message
3. **Given** application starting up, **When** `/ready` endpoint called before initialization complete, **Then** returns 503 until all components ready, then returns 200 OK (for progressive rollout)
4. **Given** external dependency unavailable, **When** health check runs, **Then** reports degraded status but allows traffic if core functionality still works

---

### User Story 3 - Performance Metrics Dashboard (Priority: P1)

Operations team monitors application performance in real-time through centralized dashboard showing key metrics (latency, throughput, resource usage) with historical trends, enabling proactive identification of performance degradation before user impact.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Essential for production operations and SLA compliance. Without performance visibility, the team cannot identify slow queries, memory leaks, or capacity issues until users complain. Required for proactive optimization.

**Independent Test**: Generate load on application, verify dashboard updates within 1 minute showing current request throughput, p95 latency, and memory usage with trend charts for last hour.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application serving traffic, **When** operations views dashboard, **Then** sees real-time metrics updated every 10 seconds: request rate, p50/p95/p99 latency, error rate, active connections
2. **Given** slow query detected (>1 second), **When** database monitoring runs, **Then** slow query appears in dashboard with query text, execution time, and frequency
3. **Given** memory usage trending upward, **When** operations views resource metrics, **Then** sees memory usage chart over time (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week views) enabling leak identification
4. **Given** API endpoint performance degraded, **When** operations investigates, **Then** can view per-endpoint latency breakdown identifying which routes are slow

---

### User Story 4 - Alert Configuration and Management (Priority: P2)

Operations team configures automated alerting rules for different severity levels (critical, warning, info) with appropriate notification channels, ensuring the right people are notified at the right time without alert fatigue.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Important for operational efficiency but not required for initial launch (can start with default alerts). Custom alert configuration allows teams to tune monitoring to their specific needs and on-call workflows.

**Independent Test**: Configure new alert rule for p95 latency >2 seconds, trigger condition by simulating slow requests, verify warning email sent within 5 minutes and alert appears in dashboard.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** operations creates critical alert rule, **When** condition triggered (e.g., error rate >10/min), **Then** immediate Slack notification sent with alert details and dashboard link
2. **Given** operations creates warning alert rule, **When** condition triggered (e.g., p95 latency >500ms sustained for 5 minutes), **Then** email notification sent within 5 minutes
3. **Given** same error occurs >100 times in 5 minutes, **When** alert suppression threshold reached, **Then** sends summary alert instead of individual notifications (prevents notification storm)
4. **Given** alert condition resolved, **When** metric returns to normal for 10 minutes, **Then** auto-resolves alert and sends resolution notification

---

### User Story 5 - Log Aggregation and Search (Priority: P2)

Operations team searches application logs across all instances using filters (timestamp, log level, user ID, request ID) to troubleshoot issues and investigate user-reported problems efficiently.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Highly valuable for troubleshooting but not blocking launch (can use server logs initially). Centralized log search dramatically reduces time to diagnose issues in multi-instance deployments.

**Independent Test**: Generate logs with specific request ID, search logs by request ID, verify all related log entries returned within 2 seconds spanning entire request lifecycle.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** operations investigating issue, **When** searches logs by request ID, **Then** retrieves all log entries for that request across all servers with timestamps and log levels
2. **Given** user reports error, **When** operations searches by user ID and time range, **Then** finds all log entries for that user's session including request parameters (sanitized)
3. **Given** logs contain ERROR level entries, **When** operations filters by log level ERROR, **Then** sees only error logs with full stack traces and context
4. **Given** high log volume, **When** searching, **Then** results returned within 2 seconds using indexed search (timestamp, log level, user ID, request ID indexed)

---

### User Story 6 - Service Health Status Page (Priority: P2)

Operations team and external stakeholders view public status page showing current health of all system components (API, database, background workers) with historical uptime percentages, providing transparency during incidents.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Important for communication and transparency but not required for launch (can communicate via email initially). Status page reduces support burden during incidents and builds customer trust.

**Independent Test**: Simulate component failure, verify status page updates within 1 minute showing component as degraded with incident details, and verify historical uptime shows accuracy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** all components healthy, **When** status page loaded, **Then** shows all components with green "Operational" status and 99.9% uptime for last 30 days
2. **Given** database experiencing issues, **When** status page checked, **Then** shows database as "Degraded" with incident description and current status
3. **Given** component fails completely, **When** status page updates, **Then** shows "Major Outage" status with estimated time to resolution and incident timeline
4. **Given** incident resolved, **When** post-mortem complete, **Then** status page shows resolution message and root cause summary (optional)

---

### User Story 7 - Performance Bottleneck Identification (Priority: P3)

Operations team receives automated analysis identifying performance bottlenecks (slow queries, N+1 query patterns, memory leaks) with recommendations for optimization, reducing manual investigation time.

**Why this priority**: P3 - Valuable automation but not required for launch (can manually analyze performance data initially). Automated bottleneck detection is a nice-to-have that improves over time.

**Independent Test**: Trigger N+1 query pattern in application, verify monitoring system detects pattern within 5 minutes and flags as performance issue with specific query examples.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application has N+1 query pattern, **When** monitoring analyzes query patterns, **Then** identifies N+1 issue with specific endpoint and query examples
2. **Given** endpoint consistently slow (>2 seconds), **When** bottleneck analysis runs, **Then** highlights endpoint with latency breakdown: database time, external API time, application logic time
3. **Given** memory usage increasing over time, **When** trend analysis detects leak pattern, **Then** alerts operations with memory growth rate and suspect components
4. **Given** multiple slow queries from same table, **When** analysis runs, **Then** suggests adding database index with estimated performance improvement

---

### User Story 8 - Metric Retention and Archival (Priority: P3)

Operations team accesses historical metrics for capacity planning and long-term trend analysis with configurable retention policies balancing storage costs and data availability.

**Why this priority**: P3 - Useful for capacity planning but not required for launch (can start with 7-day retention). Long-term retention enables year-over-year analysis but can be added later.

**Independent Test**: Query metrics from 25 days ago, verify hourly aggregates returned within 3 seconds, and verify real-time metrics (1-hour granularity) automatically deleted after 7 days per retention policy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** metric retention policy configured, **When** real-time metrics older than 7 days, **Then** automatically deleted or aggregated to hourly samples
2. **Given** operations needs capacity planning data, **When** queries metrics for last 90 days, **Then** retrieves hourly aggregates for time-series analysis
3. **Given** compliance requires 1-year retention, **When** policy set to 1 year, **Then** daily aggregates retained for full year before archival
4. **Given** storage costs monitored, **When** retention policies applied, **Then** metrics storage remains under defined budget limits through automatic aggregation and deletion

### Edge Cases

**Edge Case 1: Monitoring System Failure**
- **Scenario**: Monitoring system itself becomes unavailable
- **Expected Behavior**: Application continues operating normally, monitoring buffers metrics locally, syncs when monitoring restored
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Local metric buffer with configurable retention (1 hour default), graceful degradation

**Edge Case 2: Alert Storm Prevention**
- **Scenario**: Cascading failure triggers hundreds of alerts simultaneously
- **Expected Behavior**: Alert aggregation groups related alerts, sends summary instead of individual notifications
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Alert suppression after 100 occurrences in 5 minutes, summary alert with incident dashboard link

**Edge Case 3: High Cardinality Metrics**
- **Scenario**: Metrics with millions of unique tag combinations (e.g., per-user metrics)
- **Expected Behavior**: Automatic sampling or aggregation to prevent storage explosion
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Automatic sampling for high-cardinality metrics above configurable threshold

**Edge Case 4: Clock Skew**
- **Scenario**: Server clocks out of sync causing timestamp issues in distributed logs
- **Expected Behavior**: NTP time synchronization warnings, automatic timestamp correction based on centralized time
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] NTP monitoring alerts, log correlation using request IDs not timestamps

**Edge Case 5: Monitoring Cost Spike**
- **Scenario**: Unexpected metric volume increase causes monitoring service cost spike
- **Expected Behavior**: Budget alerts and automatic rate limiting before exceeding budget
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Daily cost monitoring, automatic metric sampling when budget threshold reached

**Edge Case 6: False Positive Alerts**
- **Scenario**: Transient network issues trigger false alerts
- **Expected Behavior**: Sustained threshold checks (e.g., 5 minutes sustained) prevent transient false positives
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Configurable sustained duration for alerts (default 5 minutes)

**Edge Case 7: Log Sensitive Data Exposure**
- **Scenario**: Logs accidentally contain passwords, API keys, or PII
- **Expected Behavior**: Automatic log scrubbing removes sensitive patterns before storage
- **Current Handling**: [TO BE IMPLEMENTED] Regex-based sensitive data scrubbing for common patterns (passwords, API keys, credit cards)

## Technical Constraints

1. **Monitoring Overhead**: Monitoring must consume <1% CPU and <100MB memory to avoid impacting application performance
2. **Log Storage Costs**: 7-day log retention with millions of requests can exceed 10GB daily requiring compression and sampling strategies
3. **Real-Time Requirements**: Error tracking must capture and display errors within 30 seconds (not minutes) requiring efficient data pipeline
4. **Distributed Systems**: Multi-instance deployment requires log correlation via request IDs (not timestamps alone due to clock skew)
5. **Network Reliability**: Monitoring must gracefully degrade when external services (Sentry, Slack) temporarily unavailable
6. **Cardinality Limits**: Metrics with user-level tags (e.g., per-user latency) can create millions of unique time series requiring sampling

---

## Assumptions

1. **Monitoring Service**: Assuming Sentry for error tracking (industry standard, generous free tier, excellent UX). Alternatives: Rollbar, Bugsnag, self-hosted Sentry
2. **Metric Granularity**: Assuming 1-minute granularity sufficient for real-time metrics (sub-minute granularity increases cost 10x with marginal value)
3. **Alert Channels**: Assuming Slack for critical alerts and email for warnings (most common operations team workflow)
4. **Log Retention**: Assuming 7-day retention sufficient for troubleshooting (90% of issues investigated within 48 hours)
5. **Health Check Frequency**: Assuming 30-second health check interval balances responsiveness with overhead (industry standard)
6. **Error Context**: Assuming user ID and organization ID available in application context for all requests (may be null for unauthenticated requests)
7. **Monitoring Budget**: Assuming $100/month monitoring budget for initial launch (covers Sentry Pro tier and log storage)
8. **Time Synchronization**: Assuming NTP configured on all production servers (required for accurate log correlation)

---

## Security Considerations

- **SEC-001**: Monitoring dashboards require JWT authentication (no anonymous access to production metrics)
- **SEC-002**: Log scrubbing automatically removes sensitive patterns (passwords, API keys, credit cards) before storage (cannot be disabled)
- **SEC-003**: Alert notifications do not include sensitive user data (user IDs included, but no passwords, payment info, or PII)
- **SEC-004**: Status page incidents published publicly do not reveal sensitive system architecture or security vulnerabilities
- **SEC-005**: Monitoring API endpoints enforce rate limiting (max 100 requests/minute per user) to prevent abuse
- **SEC-006**: Error stack traces include file paths and function names but not environment variables or configuration values
- **SEC-007**: Monitoring configuration changes audit logged with actor user ID and timestamp for security compliance
- **SEC-008**: Metric data access restricted by RBAC (developers cannot view production metrics without explicit permission)

---

## Open Questions & Decisions

### Decision 1: Monitoring Service Selection
**Decision**: Use Sentry for error tracking (vs Rollbar, Bugsnag, or self-hosted)
**Rationale**: Sentry offers excellent developer UX, generous free tier (5K errors/month), and comprehensive stack trace context. Self-hosted avoided to reduce operational burden.
**Date**: TBD (implementation phase)

### Decision 2: Metrics Storage Backend
**Decision**: Use time-series database (Prometheus, InfluxDB, or cloud-native CloudWatch/Datadog) vs relational database
**Rationale**: Time-series databases optimized for metric queries with automatic downsampling and retention policies. Relational databases not designed for high-write metric workloads.
**Date**: TBD (implementation phase)

### Decision 3: Log Aggregation Solution
**Decision**: Use centralized logging service (CloudWatch Logs, Datadog, ELK stack) vs application-level log files
**Rationale**: Centralized logging essential for multi-instance deployments. Cloud-native solutions (CloudWatch, Datadog) simpler than self-managed ELK stack.
**Date**: TBD (implementation phase)

### Decision 4: Alert Notification Provider
**Decision**: Slack for critical alerts, email for warnings vs PagerDuty/OpsGenie
**Rationale**: Slack + email sufficient for small operations team. PagerDuty adds cost and complexity justified only for larger on-call rotations.
**Date**: TBD (implementation phase)
