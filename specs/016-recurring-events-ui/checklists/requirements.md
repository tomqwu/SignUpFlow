# Specification Quality Checklist: Recurring Events User Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification describes WHAT recurring event capabilities are needed (create patterns, preview occurrences, edit series, handle exceptions) without specifying HOW to implement. Technology decisions (UI framework, calendar library, recurrence rule storage format) appropriately deferred to planning phase. Language is accessible to administrators describing scheduling workflows in plain terms.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements include specific acceptance criteria (e.g., "calendar preview updates within 1 second", "generate all occurrences within 3 seconds", "95% of administrators successfully create first series"). Success criteria use measurable metrics (5 minutes creation time vs 45 minutes manual, 90% time reduction, 70% reduction in support tickets, 8/10 satisfaction score). No clarifications needed - reasonable recurrence defaults documented in Assumptions section (maximum 104 occurrences, weekly/monthly patterns cover 90% of use cases, RFC 5545 iCalendar semantics).

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (7 prioritized user stories: 2xP1, 3xP2, 2xP3)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (12 specific UI performance and usability metrics)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. 7 user stories prioritized by value (2xP1: basic recurrence creation and visual preview - core functionality; 3xP2: series editing, exception handling, bulk operations - essential management capabilities; 2xP3: natural language descriptions, custom patterns - UX enhancements). 36 functional requirements organized across 6 recurrence capability categories (Pattern Creation, Visual Preview, Series Editing, Exception Management, Bulk Operations, Natural Language, Event Integration). 7 edge cases covering real-world scheduling scenarios (DST transitions, month-end recurrence, past occurrence editing, infinite patterns, overlapping exceptions). All technology decisions deferred to planning phase.

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

**Summary**: Specification is complete, comprehensive, and technology-agnostic. Ready for `/speckit.plan` to create technical recurring events UI implementation plan.

**Quality Score**: 100% (all checklist items passed)
