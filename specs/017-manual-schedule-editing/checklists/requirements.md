# Specification Quality Checklist: Manual Schedule Editing Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification describes WHAT manual editing capabilities are needed (drag-and-drop, constraint validation, locking, undo/redo) without specifying HOW to implement. Technology decisions (UI framework, drag library, state management) appropriately deferred to planning phase. Language is accessible to administrators describing workflow improvements in plain terms.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements include specific acceptance criteria (e.g., "drag-drop completes within 300ms", "constraint validation within 200ms", "90% complete first edit without training"). Success criteria use measurable metrics (2 minutes vs 8 minutes manual editing, 75% time reduction, 60% reduction in support tickets, 6/10 to 9/10 satisfaction improvement). No clarifications needed - reasonable editing defaults documented in Assumptions section (3-8 adjustments per schedule typical, 20-action undo history sufficient, 10-20% of schedule typically locked).

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (7 prioritized user stories: 4xP1, 2xP2, 1xP3)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (12 specific UI performance and efficiency metrics)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. 7 user stories prioritized by editing value (4xP1: drag-drop, constraint validation, swap, add/remove - core manual editing capabilities; 2xP2: locking, undo/redo - protection and safety features; 1xP3: conflict suggestions - nice-to-have assistance). 40 functional requirements organized across 7 editing capability categories (Drag-and-Drop Interaction, Real-Time Constraint Validation, Volunteer Swapping, Add/Remove Assignments, Manual Override Tracking, Assignment Locking, Undo/Redo, Conflict Resolution). 8 edge cases covering real-world editing scenarios (simultaneous edits, solver conflicts, locked assignment issues, undo limitations). All technology decisions deferred to planning phase.

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

**Summary**: Specification is complete, comprehensive, and technology-agnostic. Ready for `/speckit.plan` to create technical manual editing UI implementation plan.

**Quality Score**: 100% (all checklist items passed)
