# Feature Specification: Manual Schedule Editing Interface

**Feature Branch**: `017-manual-schedule-editing`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Type**: User Experience Enhancement (High Value)

---

## Overview

**Purpose**: Provide administrators with intuitive direct manipulation controls to fine-tune solver-generated schedules through drag-and-drop editing, role swapping, and manual overrides while maintaining schedule integrity through real-time constraint validation and conflict detection.

**Business Value**: Reduces time spent making post-solver schedule adjustments by 75% (from navigating multiple forms to direct visual manipulation), increases administrator confidence in automated scheduling by allowing manual corrections when needed, and prevents invalid schedule states through proactive constraint violation warnings before changes commit.

**Target Users**: Organization administrators (pastors, coordinators, event managers) who review and refine solver-generated schedules to address special circumstances, last-minute changes, or volunteer preferences not captured in automated constraints.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Drag-and-Drop Volunteer Assignment Between Time Slots (Priority: P1)

Administrator reassigns volunteer from one event to another by dragging their assignment card and dropping it onto a different time slot, with system immediately validating the change against availability constraints and role requirements before allowing the drop.

**Why this priority**: P1 - This is the core value proposition of manual editing. Direct manipulation is 10x faster than navigating edit forms. Without drag-and-drop, the feature provides minimal value over existing edit workflows.

**Independent Test**: Generate schedule with volunteer assigned to Sunday 10 AM service. Drag their assignment to Sunday 6 PM service. Verify constraint check occurs (availability, role match). If valid, verify assignment moves. If invalid, verify assignment snaps back with error message.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** administrator views schedule with volunteer assigned to Event A, **When** they drag assignment and drop onto Event B time slot, **Then** system validates availability and role requirements for Event B within 200ms
2. **Given** drag-drop validation passes (volunteer available and role matches), **When** administrator releases mouse, **Then** assignment moves to new event and old event shows vacancy indicator
3. **Given** drag-drop validation fails (volunteer unavailable or wrong role), **When** administrator releases mouse, **Then** assignment snaps back to original position with error message "John Smith unavailable 6-8 PM" or "Role mismatch: needs Greeter, has Usher"
4. **Given** administrator drags assignment over multiple event slots, **When** mouse hovers over each slot, **Then** visual indicator shows valid (green border) or invalid (red border) drop target
5. **Given** successful drag-drop reassignment, **When** change completes, **Then** edit is marked as manual override and logged in change history

---

### User Story 2 - Real-Time Constraint Violation Detection and Visual Warnings (Priority: P1)

System continuously monitors schedule integrity and displays visual warnings (color-coded borders, warning icons, conflict badges) when manual edits create constraint violations such as availability conflicts, unfair workload distribution, or coverage gaps.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Critical safety mechanism preventing administrators from creating invalid schedules. Without real-time validation, manual edits could break volunteer availability or fairness constraints that took hours to configure.

**Independent Test**: Manually assign volunteer to time slot when they marked unavailable. Verify immediate visual warning appears on assignment (red border, warning icon). Verify warning message explains conflict. Remove assignment, verify warning disappears.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** administrator manually assigns volunteer to event, **When** volunteer marked unavailable for that time, **Then** assignment displays with red border and warning icon within 200ms
2. **Given** assignment has constraint violation, **When** administrator hovers over warning icon, **Then** tooltip shows specific conflict details "Jane Doe marked unavailable 10 AM-12 PM on 2025-11-15"
3. **Given** manual edit creates fairness imbalance (one volunteer with 5 assignments, others with 1), **When** edit completes, **Then** fairness metrics panel shows warning "Workload imbalance detected" with affected volunteers highlighted
4. **Given** administrator removes volunteer from event creating coverage gap (role requirement not met), **When** assignment removed, **Then** event displays warning badge "Missing 1 Greeter"
5. **Given** multiple constraint violations exist, **When** administrator views schedule, **Then** summary panel shows violation count by type (3 availability conflicts, 2 coverage gaps, 1 fairness warning)

---

### User Story 3 - Swap Volunteers Between Roles (Priority: P1)

Administrator swaps two volunteers assigned to different roles at same event (e.g., swap Greeter and Usher positions) through intuitive drag-onto-drag operation, with system validating both volunteers qualify for their new roles before allowing swap.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Common real-world adjustment when volunteers request to swap duties or when role fit becomes apparent only after schedule generated. Manual form-based swapping requires 4+ clicks; drag-based swapping takes 1 action.

**Independent Test**: Create event with Volunteer A as Greeter and Volunteer B as Usher. Drag Volunteer A's assignment onto Volunteer B's assignment. Verify swap prompt appears. Confirm swap. Verify roles exchanged and both volunteers validated for new roles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** two volunteers assigned to different roles at same event, **When** administrator drags one assignment onto the other, **Then** swap confirmation dialog appears "Swap John (Greeter) with Jane (Usher)?"
2. **Given** swap confirmation shown, **When** administrator confirms, **Then** system validates both volunteers qualify for swapped roles (John can be Usher, Jane can be Greeter)
3. **Given** swap validation passes, **When** swap executes, **Then** both assignments update with new roles and change marked as manual override
4. **Given** swap validation fails (one volunteer doesn't qualify for new role), **When** validation completes, **Then** error message displays "Cannot swap: John not qualified for Usher role" and swap cancelled
5. **Given** successful swap, **When** administrator views change history, **Then** log shows "Swapped John Smith (Greeter â†” Usher) with Jane Doe" with timestamp

---

### User Story 4 - Add and Remove Manual Assignments (Priority: P1)

Administrator manually adds volunteer to unfilled role slot (solver couldn't find assignment) or removes volunteer from assignment (volunteer requested last-minute time off), with system immediately updating coverage indicators and fairness metrics.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Essential for handling situations automated solver cannot address (last-minute availability changes, volunteer special requests, manual coverage adjustments). Without add/remove, manual editing cannot address coverage gaps.

**Independent Test**: Find event with unfilled Greeter role. Click "+ Add Volunteer" button. Select volunteer from list. Verify assignment created and coverage gap resolved. Remove assignment. Verify coverage gap reappears.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** event has unfilled role slot showing "Missing 1 Greeter", **When** administrator clicks "Add Volunteer" button on empty slot, **Then** volunteer selection dropdown appears showing only volunteers qualified for Greeter role and available at event time
2. **Given** volunteer selected from dropdown, **When** administrator confirms addition, **Then** assignment created, coverage gap resolved, and fairness metrics updated to reflect additional assignment
3. **Given** assignment exists, **When** administrator clicks "Remove" button or drags assignment to trash zone, **Then** confirmation prompt appears "Remove John Smith from Greeter role?" with warning if creates coverage gap
4. **Given** remove confirmation accepted, **When** removal completes, **Then** assignment deleted, event shows coverage gap if role unfilled, and fairness metrics updated to reflect removed assignment
5. **Given** manual addition creates fairness imbalance, **When** assignment added, **Then** fairness warning displays showing affected volunteer now has disproportionate assignments

---

### User Story 5 - Lock Manual Assignments to Preserve Across Solver Re-Runs (Priority: P2)

Administrator marks specific assignments as "locked" indicating they should not be changed when scheduling solver re-runs, preserving manual corrections while allowing solver to optimize remaining unlocked assignments.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Important for protecting manual work, but manual editing (P1) must exist first. Allows iterative refinement where administrators lock satisfactory assignments and re-run solver for problematic areas.

**Independent Test**: Manually edit assignment. Lock it (pin icon). Re-run scheduling solver. Verify locked assignment unchanged. Verify unlocked assignments may have changed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** administrator manually edited assignment, **When** they click lock icon on assignment, **Then** assignment displays with lock indicator (padlock icon, different border color) and marked as protected
2. **Given** multiple assignments locked, **When** administrator re-runs scheduling solver, **Then** solver generates new schedule respecting all locked assignments as fixed constraints
3. **Given** locked assignment exists, **When** solver re-runs and would normally assign that volunteer elsewhere, **Then** solver treats locked assignment as unavailable time (volunteer cannot be assigned to conflicting events)
4. **Given** administrator wants to unlock assignment, **When** they click unlock icon, **Then** confirmation prompt appears "Unlock this assignment? Next solver run may reassign." and assignment returned to unlocked state on confirmation
5. **Given** locked assignments create unsolvable constraint set, **When** solver runs, **Then** solver returns error "Cannot generate schedule: locked assignments create conflicts" with details of conflicting locks

---

### User Story 6 - Undo and Redo Manual Edits (Priority: P2)

Administrator reverses recent manual changes through undo button (up to last 20 actions) and restores undone changes through redo button, with visual preview showing what will change before undo/redo executes.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Important safety net for exploratory editing and mistake recovery, but not critical for basic manual editing functionality. Reduces fear of making changes by allowing easy reversal.

**Independent Test**: Make 3 manual edits (drag assignment, remove volunteer, add volunteer). Click undo 3 times. Verify changes reversed in reverse chronological order. Click redo 2 times. Verify 2 changes restored.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** administrator makes manual edit (drag, add, remove, swap), **When** edit completes, **Then** action added to undo stack and undo button becomes enabled
2. **Given** undo stack not empty, **When** administrator clicks undo button, **Then** preview tooltip shows "Undo: Move John Smith back to 10 AM service" before executing
3. **Given** undo executed, **When** action reverses, **Then** schedule state restored to before that action and action moved to redo stack
4. **Given** redo stack not empty, **When** administrator clicks redo button, **Then** preview tooltip shows "Redo: Move John Smith to 6 PM service" and action re-applies
5. **Given** undo stack contains 20 actions (maximum), **When** administrator makes 21st edit, **Then** oldest action removed from stack and new action added (rolling 20-action history)

---

### User Story 7 - Conflict Resolution Suggestions (Priority: P3)

System analyzes constraint violations and provides actionable suggestions (alternative volunteers, time slot swaps, role reassignments) that would resolve conflicts with minimal schedule disruption.

**Why this priority**: P3 - Nice-to-have assistance feature, but administrators can resolve conflicts manually without suggestions. Improves efficiency but not essential for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Create availability conflict (assign volunteer to time they're unavailable). Click "Suggest Fix" button. Verify system suggests alternative volunteers available at that time. Select suggestion. Verify conflict resolved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** constraint violation exists (availability conflict), **When** administrator clicks "Suggest Fix" button on violated assignment, **Then** suggestion panel shows 3-5 alternative volunteers available at that time qualified for the role
2. **Given** suggestion alternatives displayed, **When** administrator clicks "Apply" on suggestion, **Then** original assignment replaced with suggested volunteer and violation resolved
3. **Given** no simple fix exists (no alternatives available), **When** administrator requests suggestions, **Then** message displays "No qualified alternatives available. Try: 1) Change event time, 2) Add volunteer to team, 3) Mark requirement as optional"
4. **Given** fairness imbalance exists, **When** administrator requests suggestions, **Then** system suggests redistributing assignments from overloaded volunteer to underutilized volunteers with specific swap recommendations

---

### Edge Cases

- **Simultaneous edits (multi-user)**: If two administrators edit same schedule simultaneously, last save wins with warning "Schedule changed by another user - reload to see latest version"
- **Solver re-run during manual editing**: If solver triggered while administrator actively editing, block solver execution with message "Manual editing in progress - save or discard changes before running solver"
- **Locked assignment creates impossible constraint**: When locked assignments make schedule unsolvable, solver error provides conflict details with option to identify and unlock problematic assignments
- **Undo after solver re-run**: Undo stack clears when solver generates new schedule (cannot undo automated changes, only manual changes since last solver run)
- **Drag-drop to filled slot**: When administrator drags assignment to slot already filled, offer choice "Replace existing assignment or swap volunteers?"
- **Assignment drag to incompatible event**: When dragging assignment to event with incompatible role requirements, drop rejected with message "Event requires Greeter role, volunteer assigned as Usher"
- **Mass assignment changes**: When fairness violation affects 10+ volunteers, fairness warning shows top 5 most imbalanced and link to "View all fairness issues"
- **Locked assignment with outdated availability**: If volunteer updates availability making locked assignment invalid, warning displays "Locked assignment conflicts with updated availability - review and unlock if needed"

### Key Entities

- **Manual Edit Action**: Record of administrator's schedule modification
  - Fields: action type (drag, swap, add, remove, lock, unlock), timestamp, administrator ID, affected assignments (before and after state), constraint violations created/resolved
  - Relationships: Belongs to schedule, references volunteer assignments
  - Behavior: Stored in undo stack, logged to change history, can be reversed (undo) or re-applied (redo)

- **Assignment Lock**: Marker indicating assignment protected from solver changes
  - Fields: assignment ID, locked by (administrator ID), locked at (timestamp), lock reason (optional text)
  - Relationships: References volunteer assignment
  - Behavior: Prevents solver from modifying assignment, adds constraint to solver (volunteer unavailable at this time)

- **Constraint Violation**: Detected conflict between assignment and constraints
  - Fields: violation type (availability conflict, role mismatch, fairness imbalance, coverage gap), severity (error, warning), affected assignment IDs, violation message, resolution suggestions
  - Relationships: References assignments causing violation
  - Behavior: Triggers visual warnings, enables suggestion engine, blocks invalid edits at error severity

- **Schedule Edit Session**: Container for all manual edits made between solver runs
  - Fields: session ID, started at (timestamp), last modified, administrator ID, total edits count, undo stack (action history), redo stack (reversed actions)
  - Relationships: Has many manual edit actions, belongs to schedule
  - Behavior: Maintains edit history, supports undo/redo, clears on solver re-run

---

## Assumptions

- Administrators review solver-generated schedules before publishing and typically need to make 3-8 manual adjustments per schedule
- Drag-and-drop is familiar interaction pattern for target users (administrators comfortable with modern web interfaces)
- Real-time constraint validation sufficient; administrators do not need "what-if" simulation mode
- Most manual edits are simple (move one volunteer, swap two volunteers); complex multi-step edits are rare
- Undo/redo with 20-action history covers 95% of real-world mistake recovery needs; longer history not required
- Locked assignments typically represent 10-20% of total schedule (not entire schedules locked)
- Manual editing sessions last 5-30 minutes; multi-hour editing sessions with hundreds of edits are rare

---

## Out of Scope

- **Bulk operations**: Multi-select and drag multiple assignments simultaneously (single assignment edits only)
- **Schedule comparison view**: Side-by-side comparison of solver-generated vs manually edited schedules
- **Edit conflict resolution (multi-user)**: Real-time conflict resolution when multiple administrators edit simultaneously (last save wins)
- **Custom constraint creation**: Adding new constraint types during manual editing (use constraint configuration for new constraints)
- **Automated optimization suggestions**: AI-powered suggestions for improving entire schedule (manual editing for specific known issues only)
- **Assignment templates**: Saving and applying recurring assignment patterns across multiple schedules
- **Mobile app support**: Manual editing optimized for desktop/tablet only; phone screens too small for effective drag-and-drop
