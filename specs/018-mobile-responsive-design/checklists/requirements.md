# Specification Quality Checklist: Mobile Responsive Design Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification describes WHAT mobile responsive capabilities are needed (responsive layouts, touch controls, mobile navigation, offline support, PWA features) without specifying HOW to implement. Technology decisions (responsive framework, PWA library, service worker strategy, UI component library) appropriately deferred to planning phase. Language is accessible to administrators describing mobile user experience improvements in plain terms.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements include specific acceptance criteria (e.g., "44x44px touch targets", "300ms transition time", "5 seconds page load on 3G", "100% offline content availability"). Success criteria use measurable metrics (60% engagement increase, 75% ticket reduction, 80% faster response time, 40% feature adoption). No clarifications needed - reasonable mobile defaults documented in Assumptions section (320px minimum width support, iOS Safari + Android Chrome primary browsers, PWA installation after 2+ visits, 30 days offline cache, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance).

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (8 prioritized user stories: 3xP1, 3xP2, 2xP3)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (12 specific mobile UX and performance metrics)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. 8 user stories prioritized by mobile value (3xP1: core mobile viewing, availability management, assignment responses - essential mobile workflows; 3xP2: mobile navigation, touch gestures, offline support - enhanced mobile UX; 2xP3: mobile-specific features integration, accessibility - convenience and compliance). 51 functional requirements organized across 9 mobile capability categories (Responsive Layout System, Touch-Optimized Controls, Mobile Navigation Patterns, Touch Gesture Support, Mobile Performance Optimization, Progressive Enhancement Strategy, Offline Support, Mobile-Specific Features, Mobile Accessibility, Cross-Browser Testing). 8 edge cases covering real-world mobile scenarios (orientation changes, small screens, slow networks, interrupted actions, battery saver mode, platform-specific behaviors). All technology decisions deferred to planning phase.

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

**Summary**: Specification is complete, comprehensive, and technology-agnostic. Ready for `/speckit.plan` to create technical mobile responsive design implementation plan.

**Quality Score**: 100% (all checklist items passed)
