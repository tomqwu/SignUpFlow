## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Schedule on Mobile Phone (Priority: P1)

Volunteer accesses their upcoming schedule on a smartphone with optimized layout showing schedule information clearly on small screens with touch-friendly navigation and readable text without horizontal scrolling.

**Why this priority**: P1 - This is the core mobile use case. 80% of volunteers access schedules on phones. Without optimized mobile viewing, the feature provides no value and forces volunteers to desktop-only access.

**Independent Test**: Open schedule on iPhone (375px width) and Android (360px width). Verify schedule cards stack vertically, text is readable without zoom, touch targets are minimum 44x44px, and no horizontal scrolling required. Verify same user can access same schedule on desktop with appropriate layout.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** volunteer opens schedule on smartphone, **When** page loads, **Then** layout adapts to screen width (320-768px) with single-column card stacking and readable 16px minimum font size
2. **Given** volunteer views event card on mobile, **When** they tap event details, **Then** full event information expands without horizontal scrolling and all controls are touch-accessible (44x44px minimum tap targets)
3. **Given** volunteer rotates phone from portrait to landscape, **When** orientation changes, **Then** layout re-flows appropriately within 300ms maintaining readability and usability

### User Story 2 - Manage Availability on Mobile (Priority: P1)

Volunteer marks dates unavailable using mobile-optimized date picker with large touch targets and clear visual feedback, enabling easy availability updates from anywhere without requiring desktop access.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Mobile availability management is critical for volunteer engagement. Volunteers update availability immediately when conflicts arise (during commute, at work, on weekends). Desktop-only forces delays leading to scheduling conflicts.

**Independent Test**: On mobile device, navigate to availability management. Add date range unavailable using touch-optimized date picker. Verify dates save successfully. Verify unavailable dates prevent assignments in solver. Verify same availability visible on desktop.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** volunteer accesses availability on mobile, **When** they tap "Add Unavailable Date", **Then** mobile-optimized date picker appears with 44x44px touch targets for all date controls
2. **Given** volunteer selects date range in mobile picker, **When** they confirm selection, **Then** unavailable dates save within 2 seconds with visual confirmation and appear in schedule view
3. **Given** volunteer has marked dates unavailable on mobile, **When** administrator runs solver, **Then** volunteer is not assigned to events during unavailable dates (constraint honored across devices)

---

### User Story 3 - Accept/Decline Assignment Requests on Mobile (Priority: P1)

Volunteer receives assignment request notification on mobile and can immediately accept or decline with single tap, providing quick response capability that keeps schedules updated in real-time.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Real-time assignment responses are critical for schedule accuracy. Mobile-first response enables 90% faster response times (minutes vs hours) reducing administrative follow-up and last-minute schedule changes.

**Independent Test**: Send assignment request to volunteer. Verify notification appears on mobile. Tap accept button. Verify assignment confirmed within 3 seconds. Verify assignment appears in volunteer's schedule. Verify administrator sees updated assignment status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** volunteer receives assignment request, **When** notification appears on mobile, **Then** large accept/decline buttons display (minimum 48px height) with clear action labels and visual distinction (green/red)
2. **Given** volunteer taps accept button, **When** action completes, **Then** assignment confirms within 3 seconds, success message displays, and schedule updates to show new assignment
3. **Given** volunteer taps decline button, **When** action completes, **Then** request is declined with optional reason field (mobile keyboard), administrator is notified, and volunteer sees confirmation

---

### User Story 4 - Mobile Navigation Between Key Sections (Priority: P2)

Volunteer navigates between schedule, availability, events, and profile sections using mobile-optimized navigation patterns (bottom navigation bar for primary actions, hamburger menu for secondary options) enabling efficient single-handed mobile use.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Mobile navigation efficiency significantly impacts user experience. Bottom navigation reduces thumb travel distance by 70% compared to top menus, critical for single-handed mobile use during commutes or while multitasking.

**Independent Test**: On mobile, use bottom navigation to switch between schedule, availability, events sections. Verify smooth transitions (<300ms). Verify hamburger menu accessible for profile, settings, help. Verify navigation works one-handed (thumb-reachable).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** volunteer is on schedule view, **When** they tap availability icon in bottom navigation, **Then** view switches to availability management within 300ms with smooth transition animation
2. **Given** volunteer needs to access profile, **When** they tap hamburger menu icon (top-left or top-right), **Then** slide-out menu appears showing profile, settings, help, logout options within thumb-reach
3. **Given** volunteer uses phone one-handed, **When** they navigate using bottom bar, **Then** all primary navigation targets are within comfortable thumb reach (bottom 40% of screen)

---

### User Story 5 - Touch Gestures for Schedule Interaction (Priority: P2)

Volunteer uses swipe gestures to navigate between weeks in schedule calendar, pinch-to-zoom for monthly calendar view, and long-press for quick actions, providing intuitive mobile-native interaction patterns.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Touch gesture support significantly enhances mobile UX. Swipe navigation is 5x faster than button taps for calendar navigation. Gesture support makes mobile experience feel native rather than adapted from desktop.

**Independent Test**: On mobile schedule, swipe left to view next week. Swipe right for previous week. Long-press event card to see quick actions (view details, mark unavailable). Verify gestures work smoothly with haptic feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** volunteer views weekly schedule, **When** they swipe left on calendar, **Then** calendar transitions to next week within 200ms with smooth animation and optional haptic feedback
2. **Given** volunteer views monthly calendar, **When** they use pinch-to-zoom gesture, **Then** calendar zooms between month view and week detail view with smooth 60fps animation
3. **Given** volunteer long-presses event card, **When** press duration exceeds 500ms, **Then** quick action menu appears (view details, add to phone calendar, mark unavailable) with haptic vibration feedback

---

### User Story 6 - Offline Schedule Access (Priority: P2)

Volunteer accesses previously loaded schedule information when offline (airplane mode, subway, rural areas with no signal) using service worker caching, ensuring schedule availability even without internet connectivity.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Offline access prevents schedule access failures during connectivity loss. 30% of mobile schedule views occur in low-connectivity scenarios (commute, travel, rural areas). Offline support ensures 100% schedule availability.

**Independent Test**: Load schedule on mobile with internet. Enable airplane mode. Verify schedule still viewable with "offline mode" indicator. Verify last-updated timestamp shown. Attempt to make changes, verify queued for sync when online. Disable airplane mode, verify auto-sync occurs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** volunteer has loaded schedule while online, **When** they go offline (airplane mode, no signal), **Then** previously loaded schedule remains viewable with "Offline - Last updated [timestamp]" indicator
2. **Given** volunteer is offline and views schedule, **When** they attempt to mark unavailable or accept assignment, **Then** action is queued with "Will sync when online" message and visual pending indicator
3. **Given** volunteer returns online after offline changes, **When** connectivity restores, **Then** queued actions auto-sync within 5 seconds with success confirmation and conflict resolution if schedule changed

---

### User Story 7 - Mobile-Specific Features Integration (Priority: P3)

Volunteer uses mobile-specific capabilities including adding assignments to phone calendar (iOS Calendar, Google Calendar), getting directions to event location via maps app, and receiving push notifications via Progressive Web App installation.

**Why this priority**: P3 - Mobile-native integration enhances convenience but isn't critical for core functionality. Calendar integration used by 40% of volunteers. Directions used by 25%. Push notifications increase engagement by 35% when enabled.

**Independent Test**: From event detail on mobile, tap "Add to Calendar". Verify iOS/Android calendar app opens with pre-filled event. Tap "Get Directions". Verify maps app opens with event location. Install PWA, enable push notifications, verify test notification received.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** volunteer views event detail on mobile, **When** they tap "Add to Calendar" button, **Then** native device calendar app opens (iOS Calendar or Google Calendar) with event details pre-filled (title, date, time, location, notes)
2. **Given** event includes location address, **When** volunteer taps "Get Directions" button, **Then** native maps app opens (Apple Maps or Google Maps) with route from current location to event location
3. **Given** volunteer installs SignUpFlow as Progressive Web App, **When** they enable push notifications, **Then** they receive mobile push notifications for assignment requests, schedule changes, and event reminders (with notification permission prompt)

---

### User Story 8 - Mobile Accessibility Support (Priority: P3)

Volunteer with visual impairments uses mobile screen readers (VoiceOver on iOS, TalkBack on Android) to navigate schedule, manage availability, and respond to assignments with full functionality accessible via assistive technology.

**Why this priority**: P3 - Mobile accessibility ensures inclusive volunteer participation. Screen reader users represent 5-10% of mobile users. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required for many organizations (churches, non-profits, government).

**Independent Test**: Enable VoiceOver (iOS) or TalkBack (Android). Navigate schedule using screen reader gestures. Verify all interactive elements announced correctly. Verify semantic headings allow quick navigation. Verify forms are accessible. Verify touch targets meet 44x44px minimum.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** volunteer uses iOS VoiceOver, **When** they navigate schedule, **Then** all schedule cards announce with semantic labels (role, event name, date, time, status) and allow swipe navigation between cards
2. **Given** volunteer uses TalkBack on Android, **When** they use availability form, **Then** all form fields have accessible labels, date pickers work with screen reader gestures, and validation errors are announced clearly
3. **Given** volunteer has reduced vision, **When** they increase system text size (iOS Dynamic Type or Android Font Size), **Then** SignUpFlow text scales proportionally up to 200% without breaking layout or losing functionality

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when volunteer rotates device during form input?** - Form state must persist across orientation changes without data loss. Keyboard dismissal and re-display should be smooth (<300ms).
- **How does system handle very small screens (iPhone SE 320px)?** - Layout must remain functional with single-column stacking, reduced padding, and potentially smaller but still accessible font sizes (minimum 14px).
- **What happens during slow mobile network (3G, edge)?** - Show loading indicators immediately (<100ms), implement progressive loading (critical content first), and provide offline fallback for cached content.
- **How does system handle interrupted actions (phone call during form submission)?** - Queue unsaved changes locally, prompt to resume when app returns to foreground, implement auto-save for long forms.
- **What happens when user enables battery saver mode?** - Respect reduced animation preferences, decrease polling frequency, disable non-critical background tasks, maintain core functionality.
- **How does system handle iOS Safari bottom toolbar?** - Account for toolbar height in bottom navigation positioning (use `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`), ensure controls don't hide behind toolbar.
- **What happens with mixed landscape/portrait tablet usage?** - Provide adaptive layouts that work well in both orientations, optimize for reading in portrait and data entry in landscape.
- **How does system handle platform-specific gestures (iOS back swipe, Android back button)?** - Respect native platform navigation patterns, implement appropriate routing history, handle hardware back button on Android.
