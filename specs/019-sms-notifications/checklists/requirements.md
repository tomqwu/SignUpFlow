# Specification Quality Checklist: SMS Notification System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification describes WHAT SMS notification capabilities are needed (Twilio integration, two-way messaging, compliance, cost management) while avoiding HOW to implement. Technology decisions (message queue architecture, webhook handling, compliance framework) deferred to planning phase. Language accessible to administrators describing communication enhancements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements include specific acceptance criteria (e.g., "30 seconds delivery", "60 seconds processing", "95% delivery rate", "100% TCPA compliance"). Success criteria use measurable metrics (250% response rate increase, 60% gap reduction, 98% delivery reliability, 70% template time saving). Assumptions documented (Twilio SMS API, $100 default budget, 10pm-8am quiet hours, 160-char recommended limit, E.164 phone format, 90-day audit retention).

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (8 prioritized user stories: 2xP1, 3xP2, 3xP3)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (12 specific SMS performance and compliance metrics)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. 8 user stories prioritized by SMS value (2xP1: assignment notifications, preference configuration - core SMS functionality; 3xP2: broadcast messaging, reminders, opt-out compliance - essential SMS features; 3xP3: cost management, templates, testing - SMS enhancements). 50 functional requirements organized across 9 SMS capability categories (Twilio Integration, Preference Management, Message Content, Two-Way Communication, TCPA Compliance, Rate Limiting, Cost Management, Templates, Delivery Tracking, Testing). 8 edge cases covering real-world SMS scenarios (invalid numbers, carrier outages, unexpected replies, international numbers, quiet hours, spam prevention, number changes, long messages). All technology decisions deferred to planning phase.

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

**Summary**: Specification is complete, comprehensive, and technology-agnostic. Ready for `/speckit.plan` to create technical SMS notification implementation plan.

**Quality Score**: 100% (all checklist items passed)
