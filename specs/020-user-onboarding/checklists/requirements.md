# Specification Quality Checklist: User Onboarding System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification describes WHAT onboarding capabilities are needed (setup wizard, sample data, interactive tutorials, progressive disclosure, skip option, analytics) without specifying HOW to implement. Technology decisions (wizard framework, tutorial library, analytics platform, sample data generation strategy) appropriately deferred to planning phase. Language is accessible to administrators describing user activation improvements in plain terms.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements include specific acceptance criteria (e.g., "15 minutes completion time", "5 wizard steps", "5 seconds sample data generation", "30-day state retention"). Success criteria use measurable metrics (85% activation increase, 70% support ticket reduction, 75% wizard completion, 90% checklist engagement). No clarifications needed - reasonable onboarding defaults documented in Assumptions section (automatic wizard launch on first login, 30-day onboarding state retention, 5-step wizard flow, 15-minute estimated completion, sample data expiry after 30 days of inactivity, progressive unlocking after proficiency milestones).

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (8 prioritized user stories: 2xP1, 3xP2, 3xP3)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (12 specific activation and learning metrics)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. 8 user stories prioritized by onboarding value (2xP1: setup wizard, sample data - foundational activation; 3xP2: checklist, tutorials, videos - learning support; 3xP3: progressive disclosure, skip option, analytics - optimization). 45 functional requirements organized across 7 onboarding capability categories (Setup Wizard Flow, Sample Data Generation, Getting Started Checklist, Interactive Tutorials, Quick Start Videos, Progressive Feature Disclosure, Skip and Resume Capabilities, Onboarding State Persistence, Help and Support Integration, Onboarding Analytics, Celebration Moments). 8 edge cases covering real-world onboarding scenarios (abandoned wizard, imported data conflicts, multiple admins, sample data expiration, wizard skipping, partial progress, rapid feature unlocking, onboarding during organization migration). All technology decisions deferred to planning phase.

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

**Summary**: Specification is complete, comprehensive, and technology-agnostic. Ready for `/speckit.plan` to create technical user onboarding implementation plan.

**Quality Score**: 100% (all checklist items passed)
