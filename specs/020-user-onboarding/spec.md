# Feature Specification: User Onboarding System

**Feature Branch**: `020-user-onboarding`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Type**: User Experience Enhancement (Medium Value)

---

## Overview

**Purpose**: Guide new organization administrators through essential setup and configuration with step-by-step wizard, interactive tutorials, sample data generation, and progressive feature disclosure, reducing time-to-first-value from average 2 hours (manual exploration) to 15 minutes (guided onboarding).

**Business Value**: Increases new organization activation rate by 85% (from 35% to 65% completing first schedule within 7 days), reduces support tickets from confused new users by 70%, and accelerates feature discovery enabling administrators to leverage advanced capabilities (recurring events, manual editing) 3x faster than self-guided exploration.

**Target Users**: Organization administrators setting up SignUpFlow for the first time, ranging from small churches (5-10 volunteers) to large non-profits (100+ volunteers).

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete Guided Setup Wizard (Priority: P1)

New administrator completes step-by-step setup wizard walking through essential configuration (organization profile, first event, first team, volunteer invitations) with contextual help and validation at each step, resulting in fully functional organization ready to generate first schedule within 15 minutes.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Setup wizard is foundational onboarding experience. Without guided configuration, 65% of new users abandon before creating first schedule. Wizard completion predicts 90% long-term activation.

**Independent Test**: Create new organization account. Enter setup wizard. Complete organization profile (name, location, timezone). Create first event with all required fields. Create first team with role. Invite 3 volunteers via email. Verify all steps validated. Verify organization fully configured and ready for scheduling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new administrator creates organization account, **When** they login for first time, **Then** setup wizard launches automatically with progress indicator showing 5 steps and estimated 15-minute completion time
2. **Given** administrator on wizard step 1 (organization profile), **When** they enter organization name, location, and select timezone from dropdown, **Then** fields validate in real-time with helpful error messages ("Location helps auto-detect volunteer timezones") and next button enables when all required fields complete
3. **Given** administrator completes all 5 wizard steps, **When** they click "Finish Setup", **Then** confirmation screen displays "ðŸŽ‰ You're ready to schedule! Your organization is set up and ready to create schedules" with button to dashboard

---

### User Story 2 - Explore Features with Sample Data (Priority: P1)

Administrator explores SignUpFlow features using pre-generated sample data (example events, teams, volunteers, generated schedule) without manually creating test data, enabling hands-on learning and feature discovery in realistic environment that can be cleared when ready for production use.

**Why this priority**: P1 - Sample data dramatically reduces exploration friction. Administrators understand features 5x faster with realistic examples vs empty system. Critical for demonstrating solver value before investing time in real data entry.

**Independent Test**: Complete setup wizard. Click "Generate Sample Data" option. Verify system creates 5 sample events, 3 teams, 15 sample volunteers, and generated schedule. Explore features (view schedule, edit event, run solver). Click "Clear Sample Data" button. Verify all sample data removed, real configuration preserved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** administrator completes setup wizard, **When** onboarding offers "Explore with sample data" option, **Then** clicking "Yes" generates realistic dataset: 5 upcoming events (Sunday services, Wednesday nights), 3 teams (worship, hospitality, tech), 15 sample volunteers with availability patterns, and one generated schedule showing assignments
2. **Given** administrator exploring with sample data, **When** they navigate to schedule view, **Then** sample schedule displays with visual indicator "Sample Data - explore features then clear when ready" and sample volunteers clearly marked with "(Sample)" prefix
3. **Given** administrator ready for production use, **When** they click "Clear Sample Data and Start Fresh", **Then** confirmation dialog warns "This will remove all sample events, teams, and volunteers. Your organization settings will be preserved." and clearing completes within 5 seconds

---

### User Story 3 - Track Onboarding Progress with Checklist (Priority: P2)

Administrator sees onboarding checklist showing completion status for key setup tasks (complete profile, create first event, add team, invite volunteers, run first schedule, view reports) with visual progress indicator and quick links to incomplete steps, providing clear path to activation and sense of accomplishment.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Checklist provides motivation and direction after initial wizard. Increases completion rate of advanced features by 40% through clear next actions. Enhancement to core wizard experience.

**Independent Test**: Complete wizard (partial checklist items checked). View onboarding dashboard with checklist showing 3/6 tasks complete. Click "Create first event" quick link. Complete task. Return to dashboard. Verify checklist updates to 4/6 with visual progress. Complete all 6 tasks. Verify celebration message "ðŸŽ‰ Onboarding Complete! You've mastered the basics."

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** administrator views onboarding dashboard, **When** checklist displays, **Then** shows 6 key tasks with checkmarks for completed, empty circles for pending, and progress bar showing "3 of 6 complete (50%)" with encouraging message "You're halfway there!"
2. **Given** administrator clicks incomplete checklist item, **When** they click "Create first event", **Then** navigates directly to event creation form with contextual tooltip "Create an event that needs volunteer assignments. This will be your first scheduled activity"
3. **Given** administrator completes final checklist task, **When** onboarding system detects completion, **Then** celebration modal appears "ðŸŽ‰ Onboarding Complete! You've created events, teams, volunteers, and your first schedule. Ready to explore advanced features?" with button to dismiss checklist from dashboard

---

### User Story 4 - Learn Features with Interactive Tutorials (Priority: P2)

Administrator accesses interactive tutorials with tooltips, walkthrough overlays, and contextual help for key features (event creation, solver usage, manual editing) triggered automatically during first use or accessible via help menu, reducing learning curve and support dependency.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Interactive tutorials reduce support tickets by 50% for common workflows. Enhances user confidence and accelerates feature adoption but not required for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to events page for first time. Observe automatic walkthrough overlay highlighting "Create Event" button with tooltip "Events are activities that need volunteer assignments like Sunday service or community outreach". Click through 4-step overlay. Verify tutorial dismisses. Access help menu. Select "Show Event Tutorial Again". Verify tutorial replays.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** administrator accesses feature for first time (events, teams, solver), **When** page loads, **Then** overlay dims background and highlights key UI element with animated tooltip "Let's create your first event! Click here to get started" with next/skip options
2. **Given** administrator viewing tutorial step 3 of 5, **When** they click interface element as instructed, **Then** tooltip updates to next step providing context: "Great! Now select the roles needed for this event. You can add multiple roles like 'Worship Leader' or 'Greeter'" with smart progression detecting user action
3. **Given** administrator wants to replay tutorial, **When** they access help menu (? icon in navigation), **Then** menu lists available tutorials (Events, Teams, Solver, Manual Editing, Reports) with completion status and option to replay any tutorial

---

### User Story 5 - Access Quick Start Videos and Documentation (Priority: P2)

Administrator watches concise quick start videos (2-3 minutes each) demonstrating key workflows (creating events, inviting volunteers, running solver, managing assignments) with links to detailed documentation, providing self-service learning resources for different learning preferences.

**Why this priority**: P2 - Video content serves visual learners (40% preference) and provides reference for complex workflows. Complements written tutorials but not critical for initial activation.

**Independent Test**: Access onboarding dashboard. View "Quick Start Videos" section showing 5 video thumbnails with titles and duration. Click "How to Run the Solver (3 min)". Verify video plays in modal with controls (play, pause, full-screen). Close video. Click "View Full Documentation" link. Verify documentation opens in new tab.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** administrator viewing onboarding dashboard, **When** "Quick Start Videos" section displays, **Then** shows 5 video cards: "Creating Your First Event (2 min)", "Inviting Volunteers (2 min)", "Running the Solver (3 min)", "Managing Schedules (3 min)", "Advanced Features (3 min)" with thumbnail previews
2. **Given** administrator clicks video thumbnail, **When** modal opens, **Then** video plays with controls, current timestamp, and sidebar showing video outline with timestamped chapters enabling jumping to specific topics
3. **Given** administrator watching video, **When** they click "View Documentation" link in video description, **Then** opens detailed text documentation for same topic in new browser tab maintaining video playback state

---

### User Story 6 - Progressive Feature Disclosure (Priority: P3)

Administrator experiences gradual revelation of advanced features (recurring events, manual schedule editing, SMS notifications) after mastering basic workflows, preventing overwhelming initial complexity while ensuring feature discovery as proficiency increases.

**Why this priority**: P3 - Progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load for new users but advanced users can access full feature set immediately via settings. Nice-to-have enhancement to learning experience.

**Independent Test**: New administrator completes basic onboarding. Verify advanced features hidden in menu with "Coming Soon" badge. Create 3 events and run solver successfully. Verify system detects proficiency and reveals advanced features with in-app notification "You've unlocked Recurring Events! Create repeating schedules to save time." Verify features now accessible in menu.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new administrator with <3 events created, **When** they view navigation menu, **Then** advanced features (Recurring Events, Manual Editing, SMS Notifications) show with lock icon and tooltip "Complete basic setup to unlock advanced features"
2. **Given** administrator reaches proficiency milestone (5 events created, 3 schedules generated), **When** system detects achievement, **Then** notification toast appears "ðŸŽ‰ You've unlocked Recurring Events! Create weekly or monthly event patterns to save time scheduling" with "Learn More" button to tutorial
3. **Given** administrator prefers immediate access to all features, **When** they enable "Show all features" toggle in settings, **Then** all advanced features immediately accessible bypassing progressive disclosure with optional tour of newly enabled features

---

### User Story 7 - Skip Onboarding for Experienced Users (Priority: P3)

Experienced administrator (familiar with scheduling software) skips onboarding wizard and accesses full feature set immediately, avoiding frustration from forced tutorial progression while still having option to access onboarding resources if needed.

**Why this priority**: P3 - Skip option prevents alienating power users (10-15% of new users) but most users benefit from guided onboarding. Low-effort inclusion improves satisfaction for minority user segment.

**Independent Test**: Create new organization account. On wizard first screen, click "Skip Onboarding - I'm Experienced" link. Verify confirmation dialog warns about missing guided setup. Confirm skip. Verify navigation to full dashboard with all features accessible. Access help menu. Verify "Restart Onboarding" option available.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new administrator viewing setup wizard welcome screen, **When** "Skip Onboarding" link visible at bottom, **Then** clicking shows confirmation "Are you sure? The guided setup helps ensure everything is configured correctly. You can always access onboarding resources in the help menu" with "Skip Anyway" and "Continue Onboarding" buttons
2. **Given** administrator confirms skip, **When** onboarding bypassed, **Then** navigates directly to full dashboard with all features unlocked, onboarding checklist hidden, but help icon shows "New? Start Onboarding" option
3. **Given** administrator skipped onboarding but needs guidance later, **When** they access help menu â†’ "Start Onboarding", **Then** can restart wizard from beginning or jump to specific section (profile, events, teams, volunteers, solver)

---

### User Story 8 - Onboarding Analytics and Optimization (Priority: P3)

System tracks onboarding metrics (completion rate, drop-off points, time-to-first-value, feature adoption) enabling product team to identify friction points and optimize onboarding flow based on data, improving activation rates over time.

**Why this priority**: P3 - Analytics enable continuous improvement but not user-facing feature. Benefits accrue over time through optimization insights. Low priority for initial release.

**Independent Test**: Administrator completes various onboarding paths (full wizard, skip, partial completion). Access admin analytics dashboard. View onboarding metrics: 65% completion rate, average 18 minutes to first schedule, 40% drop-off at "invite volunteers" step. Verify cohort analysis showing impact of onboarding improvements on activation rates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple organizations complete onboarding, **When** product admin views analytics dashboard, **Then** displays funnel visualization showing completion rates for each wizard step with drop-off percentages and cohort comparison over time
2. **Given** onboarding flow modified (new tutorial added), **When** analytics system detects change, **Then** creates new cohort automatically and tracks impact on completion rate, time-to-first-value, and 7-day activation comparing before/after metrics
3. **Given** product team reviews onboarding data, **When** specific step shows high drop-off (>30%), **Then** drill-down view shows session recordings of users abandoning at that step, common error messages, and time spent before abandonment

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when administrator abandons wizard mid-flow?** - System saves partial progress enabling resume later. Re-login shows "Continue Setup" option returning to last completed step. Partial data persists (organization profile if entered) but incomplete configuration flagged.
- **How does system handle onboarding for organizations with imported data?** - Import flow bypasses data entry steps (events, volunteers already exist) and shows customized checklist focusing on SignUpFlow-specific features (solver usage, scheduling workflows, notification setup).
- **What happens when organization has multiple administrators?** - Primary creator completes initial onboarding. Subsequent administrators see abbreviated "Welcome to [Org Name]" orientation focusing on their role and permissions rather than full setup wizard.
- **How does system prevent showing onboarding to returning users?** - Onboarding state tracked per organization (not per admin). Once any admin completes setup, subsequent logins skip wizard and show regular dashboard. Users can manually restart via help menu if needed.
- **What happens when administrator enables sample data then forgets to clear it?** - Sample data includes expiration date (30 days from creation). System sends reminder at 7 days before expiration and auto-archives (not deletes) sample data at expiration with option to restore if needed.
- **How does onboarding adapt to organization size?** - Wizard detects organization size from initial questions (small <20 volunteers, medium 20-100, large >100) and adjusts recommendations: small orgs shown simple workflows, large orgs shown team structure and delegation features.
- **What happens when video playback fails (network issue)?** - Fallback to animated GIF demonstrating same workflow or static step-by-step screenshots with text instructions. Videos cached after first play for offline replay.
- **How does system handle users who repeatedly dismiss tutorials?** - After 3 tutorial dismissals, system stops auto-showing tutorials and displays one-time message "We notice you're exploring on your own. Tutorials disabled. Access anytime via help menu (?) or enable in settings" respecting user preference.
