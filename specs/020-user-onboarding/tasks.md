# Tasks: User Onboarding System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/020-user-onboarding/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification - focusing on implementation tasks

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Backend**: `api/services/`, `api/routers/`, `api/models.py`, `api/utils/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/js/`, `frontend/css/`, `frontend/videos/`
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`
- **Database**: `migrations/versions/`
- **Docs**: `docs/`, `locales/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1 (P1) ‚Üí US2 (P1) ‚Üí US3 (P2) ‚Üí US4 (P2) ‚Üí US5 (P2) ‚Üí US6 (P3) ‚Üí US7 (P3) ‚Üí US8 (P3)
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1) - Setup Wizard**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (P1) - Sample Data**: Can start after Foundational - Integrates with US1 (generates data after wizard completes) but independently testable
- **US3 (P2) - Checklist**: Can start after Foundational - Integrates with US1 (wizard completion = checklist task) but independently testable
- **US4 (P2) - Tutorials**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories, standalone feature
- **US5 (P2) - Videos**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories, standalone feature
- **US6 (P3) - Progressive Disclosure**: Requires US1 complete (wizard provides initial proficiency data)
- **US7 (P3) - Skip Wizard**: Requires US1 complete (skip alternative to wizard flow)
- **US8 (P3) - Analytics**: Can start after Foundational - Tracks events from all stories but doesn't block them

### Within Each User Story

- Service layer methods before API endpoints
- API endpoints before frontend UI components
- Frontend components before integration/polish
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: T001, T002, T003 can all run in parallel
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: T009-T012 (model classes) can run in parallel
- **Within US1**: T017-T021 (service methods) can run in parallel, T026-T027 (frontend) can run in parallel
- **Within US2**: T035-T039 (generator methods) can run in parallel, T048 (UI) can run independently
- **Within US3**: T055-T060 (service methods) can run in parallel
- **Within US4**: T073-T077 (service methods) can run in parallel, T080-T084 (tutorial definitions) can run in parallel
- **Within US5**: T090-T091 (video setup) can run in parallel
- **Within US6**: T100-T103 (service methods) can run in parallel, T105-T106 (UI) can run in parallel
- **Within US7**: T111-T112 (service methods) can run in parallel, T115-T116 (UI) can run in parallel
- **Within US8**: T121-T125 (service methods) can run in parallel, T131-T136 (tracking) can run in parallel
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: T140-T150 can all run in parallel
- **Different user stories**: US3, US4, US5 can all be worked on in parallel after Foundational completes

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T016) - CRITICAL BLOCKER
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Setup Wizard (T017-T034)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Sample Data (T035-T054)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test wizard + sample data flow end-to-end
6. Deploy/demo if ready - New users can complete guided setup with examples!

**Why this MVP?**: US1 + US2 provide core onboarding value - guided setup with hands-on examples. Reduces time-to-first-value from 2 hours to 15 minutes. Other stories enhance experience but these two are essential.

### Incremental Delivery

1. MVP: Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2 ‚Üí Deploy (Core onboarding working)
2. Add US3 (Checklist) ‚Üí Deploy (Now with progress tracking)
3. Add US4 (Tutorials) ‚Üí Deploy (Now with interactive learning)
4. Add US5 (Videos) ‚Üí Deploy (Now with video content)
5. Add US6 (Progressive Disclosure) ‚Üí Deploy (Now with smart feature unlocking)
6. Add US7 (Skip Option) ‚Üí Deploy (Now with power user support)
7. Add US8 (Analytics) ‚Üí Deploy (Now with data-driven optimization)
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup (Phase 1) + Foundational (Phase 2) together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Setup Wizard)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Sample Data)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Checklist)
   - **Developer D**: User Story 4 (Tutorials)
3. Stories complete independently, integrate naturally
4. Continue with US5-US8 in priority order

- **Wizard Completion**: Target >75% completion with <20% drop-off per step
- **Sample Data Adoption**: Target 60% of new orgs generating sample data
- **Checklist Completion**: Target 85% completing all 6 tasks within 7 days
- **Tutorial Engagement**: Target 50% viewing at least one tutorial
- **Video Engagement**: Target 40% watching at least one complete video
- **Support Ticket Reduction**: Target 70% reduction in new user confusion tickets
- **Feature Discovery**: Target 3x faster (7 days vs 21 days) for advanced features
- **Skip Rate**: Target <15% (most users find onboarding valuable)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group of related tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Tests not explicitly requested in spec - focusing on implementation
- MVP = US1 + US2 provides core value for 65% activation goal
- All advanced stories (US6-US8) are enhancements, not blockers
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, tight cross-story dependencies

---

**Total Tasks**: 157 tasks
**MVP Tasks**: 54 tasks (T001-T054 covering Setup, Foundational, US1, US2)
**Parallel Opportunities**: 60+ parallelizable tasks marked with [P]
**Estimated Implementation Time**: 8-12 weeks for full feature, 3-4 weeks for MVP
